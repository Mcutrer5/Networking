#### a. Overview

- The **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** is the brain of a computer, responsible for executing instructions.
- CPU architecture refers to the design and structure of the processor.

#### b. Common Architectures

1. **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing):**
    
    - Supports a large set of complex instructions.
    - Commonly found in desktop and laptop processors.
2. **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing):**
    
    - Emphasizes a smaller set of simple instructions.
    - Typically used in mobile devices and specialized applications.
3. **Multi-Core Processors:**
    
    - Combine multiple processing cores on a single chip.
    - Enhances multitasking and parallel processing capabilities.
