#### a. Overview

- Ensuring the security of wireless networks is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
- Common security protocols include WEP, WPA, and WPA2/WPA3.

#### b. Key Security Protocols

1. **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):**
    
    - An early security protocol that encrypts data using a static key.
    - Vulnerable to security attacks and no longer considered secure.
2. **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):**
    
    - Introduced as an interim solution to address WEP vulnerabilities.
    - Utilizes Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) for improved security.
3. **WPA2/WPA3:**
    
    - WPA2 is an improvement over WPA, using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for stronger encryption.
    - WPA3 further enhances security with features like individualized data encryption and protection against brute-force attacks.

#### c. Considerations

- Choose the strongest available security protocol based on device and network support.
- Regularly update security protocols to mitigate vulnerabilities.
