As you have learned, there are many types of malware that hackers can use. But these are not the only ways that they can attack a network, or even an organization.

When malware is delivered and installed, the payload can be used to cause a variety of network related attacks.

Networks are susceptible to the following types of attacks:

- Reconnaissance Attacks
- Access Attacks
- DoS Attacks
