Reconnaissance is information gathering. It is analogous to a thief surveying a neighborhood by going door-to-door pretending to sell something. What the thief is actually doing is looking for vulnerable homes to break into, such as unoccupied residences, residences with easy-to-open doors or windows, and those residences without security systems or security cameras.

Threat actors use reconnaissance (or recon) attacks to do unauthorized discovery and mapping of systems, services, or vulnerabilities. Recon attacks precede access attacks or DoS attacks.

Some of the techniques used by malicious threat actors to conduct reconnaissance attacks are described in the table.

| **Technique**                               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Perform an information query of a target    | The threat actor is looking for initial information about a target. Various tools can be used, including the Google search, organizations, whois, and more.                                                                             |
| Initiate a ping sweep of the target network | The information query usually reveals the target's network address. The threat actor can now initiate a ping sweep to determine which IP addresses are active.                                                                          |
| Initiate a port scan of active IP addresses | This is used to determine which ports or services are available. Examples of port scanners include Nmap, SuperScan, Angry IP Scanner, and NetScanTools.                                                                                 |
| Run vulnerability scanners                  | This is to query the identified ports to determine the type and version of the application and operating system that is running on the host. Examples of tools include Nipper, Secuna PSI, Core Impact, Nessus v6, SAINT, and Open VAS. |
| Run exploitation tools                      | The threat actor now attempts to discover vulnerable services that can be exploited. A variety of vulnerability exploitation tools exist including Metasploit, Core Impact, Sqlmap, Social Engineer Toolkit, and Netsparker.            |
