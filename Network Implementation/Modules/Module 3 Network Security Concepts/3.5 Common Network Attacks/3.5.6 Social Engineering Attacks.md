Social engineering is an access attack that attempts to manipulate individuals into performing actions or divulging confidential information. Some social engineering techniques are performed in-person while others may use the telephone or internet.

Social engineers often rely on people’s willingness to be helpful. They also prey on people’s weaknesses. For example, a threat actor could call an authorized employee with an urgent problem that requires immediate network access. The threat actor could appeal to the employee’s vanity, invoke authority using name-dropping techniques, or appeal to the employee’s greed.

Information about social engineering techniques is shown in the table.

| Pretexting                    | A threat actor pretends to need personal or financial data to confirm the identity of the recipient                                                                                                                |
| Phishing                      | A threat actor sends fraudulent email which is disguised as being from a legitimate, trusted source to trick the recipient into installing malware on their device, or to share personal or financial information. |
| Spear phishing                | A threat actor creates a targeted phishing attack tailored for a specific individual or organization.                                                                                                              |
| Spam                          | Also known as junk main, this is unsolicited email which often contains harmful links, malware or deceptive content.                                                                                               |
| Something for Something       | Sometimes called "Quid pro quo", this is when a threat actor requests personal information from a party in exchange for something such as a gift.                                                                  |
| Baiting                       | A threat actor leaves a malware infected flash drive in a public location. A victim finds the drive and unsuspectingly inserts it into their laptop, unintentionally installing malware.                           |
| Impersonation                 | This type of attack is where a threat actor pretends to be someone they are not to gain the trust of a victim.                                                                                                     |
| Tailgating                    | This is where a threat actor quickly follows an authorized person into a secure location to gain access to a secure area.                                                                                          |
| Shoulder surfing              | This is where a threat actor inconspicuously looks over someone's shoulder to steal their passwords or other information.                                                                                          |
| Dumpster diving               | This is where a threat actor rummages through trash bins to discover confidential documents.                                                                                                                       |

The Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) was designed to help white hat hackers and other network security professionals create social engineering attacks to test their own networks.

Enterprises must educate their users about the risks of social engineering, and develop strategies to validate identities over the phone, via email, or in person.
