Ethical hacking involves many different types of tools used to test the network and keep its data secure. To validate the security of a network and its systems, many network penetration testing tools have been developed. It is unfortunate that many of these tools can be used by black hat hackers for exploitation.

Black hat hackers have also created many hacking tools. These tools are created explicitly for nefarious reasons. White hat hackers must also know how to use these tools when performing network penetration tests.

The table highlights categories of common penetration testing tools. Notice how some tools are used by white hats and black hats. Keep in mind that the list is not exhaustive as new tools are always being developed.
