In the previous topic, you gained a high-level look at the current landscape of cybersecurity, including the types of threats and vulnerabilities that plague all network administrators and architects. In this topic, you will learn more details about particular types of threat actors.

Hacker is a common term used to describe a threat actor. Originally the term referred to someone who was a skilled computer expert such as a programmer and a hack was a clever solution. The term later evolved into what we know of it today.

As shown in the table, the terms white hat hacker, black hat hacker, and gray hat hacker are often used to describe a type of hacker.

| White Hat Hackers | These are ethical hackers who use their programming skills for good, ethical, and legal purposes. White hat hackers may perform network penetration tests in an attempt to compromise networks and systems by using their knowledge of computer security systems to discover network vulnerabilities. Security vulnerabilities are reported to developers for them to fix before the vulnerabilities can be exploited. |
| Gray Hat Hackers  | These are individuals who commit crimes and do arguably unethical things, but not for personal gain or to cause damage. Gray hat hackers may disclose a vulnerability to the affected organization after having compromised their network.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Black Hat Hackers | These are unethical criminals who compromise computer and network security for personal gain, or for malicious reasons, such as attacking networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

**Note:** In this course, we will not use the term hacker outside of this module. We will use the term threat actor. The term threat actor includes hackers. But threat actor also includes any device, person, group, or nation state that is, intentionally or unintentionally, the source of an attack.
