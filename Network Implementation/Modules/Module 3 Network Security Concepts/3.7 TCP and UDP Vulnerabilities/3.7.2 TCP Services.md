TCP provides these services:

- **Reliable delivery** - TCP incorporates acknowledgments to guarantee delivery, instead of relying on upper-layer protocols to detect and resolve errors. If a timely acknowledgment is not received, the sender retransmits the data. Requiring acknowledgments of received data can cause substantial delays. Examples of application layer protocols that make use of TCP reliability include HTTP, SSL/TLS, FTP, DNS zone transfers, and others.
- **Flow control** - TCP implements flow control to address this issue. Rather than acknowledge one segment at a time, multiple segments can be acknowledged with a single acknowledgment segment.
- **Stateful communication** - TCP stateful communication between two parties occurs during the TCP three-way handshake. Before data can be transferred using TCP, a three-way handshake opens the TCP connection, as shown in the figure. If both sides agree to the TCP connection, data can be sent and received by both parties using TCP.

A TCP connection is established in three steps:<br/>1. The initiating client requests a client-to-server communication session with the server.<br/>2. The server acknowledges the client-to-server communication session and requests a server-to-client communication session.<br/>3. The initiating client acknowledges the server-to-client communication session.
