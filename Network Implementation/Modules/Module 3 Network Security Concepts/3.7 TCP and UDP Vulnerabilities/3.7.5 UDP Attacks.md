UDP is not protected by any encryption. You can add encryption to UDP, but it is not available by default. The lack of encryption means that anyone can see the traffic, change it, and send it on to its destination. Changing the data in the traffic will alter the 16-bit checksum, but the checksum is optional and is not always used. When the checksum is used, the threat actor can create a new checksum based on the new data payload, and then record it in the header as a new checksum. The destination device will find that the checksum matches the data without knowing that the data has been altered. This type of attack is not widely used.

**UDP Flood Attacks**

You are more likely to see a UDP flood attack. In a UDP flood attack, all the resources on a network are consumed. The threat actor must use a tool like UDP Unicorn or Low Orbit Ion Cannon. These tools send a flood of UDP packets, often from a spoofed host, to a server on the subnet. The program will sweep through all the known ports trying to find closed ports. This will cause the server to reply with an ICMP port unreachable message. Because there are many closed ports on the server, this creates a lot of traffic on the segment, which uses up most of the bandwidth. The result is very similar to a DoS attack.
