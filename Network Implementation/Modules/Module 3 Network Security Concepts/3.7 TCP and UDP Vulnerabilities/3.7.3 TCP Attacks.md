Network applications use TCP or UDP ports. Threat actors conduct port scans of target devices to discover which services they offer.

**TCP SYN Flood Attack**

The TCP SYN Flood attack exploits the TCP three-way handshake. The figure shows a threat actor continually sending TCP SYN session request packets with a randomly spoofed source IP address to a target. The target device replies with a TCP SYN-ACK packet to the spoofed IP address and waits for a TCP ACK packet. Those responses never arrive. ==Eventually the target host is overwhelmed with half-open TCP connections, and TCP services are denied to legitimate users.==

1. The threat actor sends multiple SYN requests to a web server.
<br/>2. The web server replies with SYN-ACKs for each SYN request and waits to complete the three-way handshake. The threat actor does not respond to the SYN-ACKs.
<br/>3. A valid user cannot access the web server because the web server has too many half-opened TCP connections.

**TCP Reset Attack**
---
A TCP reset attack can be used to terminate TCP communications between two hosts. TCP can terminate a connection in a civilized (i.e., normal) manner and uncivilized (i.e., abrupt) manner.

The figure displays the civilized manner when TCP uses a four-way exchange consisting of a pair of FIN and ACK segments from each TCP endpoint to close the TCP connection.

The uncivilized manner is when a host receives an TCP segment with the RST bit set. This is an abrupt way to tear down the TCP connection and inform the receiving host to immediately stop using the TCP connection.

A threat actor could do a TCP reset attack and send a spoofed packet containing a TCP RST to one or both endpoints.

Terminating a TCP session uses the following four-way exchange process:

<br/>1. When the client has no more data to send in the stream, it sends a segment with the FIN flag set.
<br/>2. The server sends an ACK to acknowledge the receipt of the FIN to terminate the session from client to server.
<br/>3. The server sends a FIN to the client to terminate the server-to-client session.
<br/>4. The client responds with an ACK to acknowledge the FIN from the server.
</div>

### **TCP Session Hijacking**
---

TCP session hijacking is another TCP vulnerability. Although difficult to conduct, a threat actor takes over an already-authenticated host as it communicates with the target. The threat actor must spoof the IP address of one host, predict the next sequence number, and send an ACK to the other host. If successful, the threat actor could send, but not receive, data from the target device.
