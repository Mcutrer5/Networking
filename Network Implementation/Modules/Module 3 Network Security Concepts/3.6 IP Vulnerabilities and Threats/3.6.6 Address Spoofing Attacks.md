Threat actors use ICMP for reconnaissance and scanning attacks. They can launch information-gathering attacks to map out a network topology, discover which hosts are active (reachable), identify the host operating system (OS fingerprinting), and determine the state of a firewall. Threat actors also use ICMP for DoS attacks.

**Note:** ICMP for IPv4 (ICMPv4) and ICMP for IPv6 (ICMPv6) are susceptible to similar types of attacks.

Networks should have strict ICMP access control list (ACL) filtering on the network edge to avoid ICMP probing from the internet. Security analysts should be able to detect ICMP-related attacks by looking at captured traffic and log files. In the case of large networks, security devices such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS) detect such attacks and generate alerts to the security analysts.

Common ICMP messages of interest to threat actors are listed in the table.

| ICMP Messages used by Hackers    | Description                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ICMP echo request and echo reply | This is used to perform host verification and DoS attacks.                                                        |
| ICMP unreachable                 | This is used to perform network reconnaissance and scanning attacks.                                              |
| ICMP mask reply                  | This is used to map an internal IP network.                                                                       |
| ICMP redirects                   | This is used to lure a target host into sending all traffic through a compromised device and create a MITM attack |
| ICMP router discovery            | This is used to inject bogus route entries into the routing table of a target host.                               |
