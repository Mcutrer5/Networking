Threat actors often use amplification and reflection techniques to create DoS attacks. The example in the figure illustrates how an amplification and reflection technique called a Smurf attack is used to overwhelm a target host.

<div style="width: 100%; font-style: italic; font-size: .8em; border: solid grey 2px; padding: 4px;">
1. <b>Amplification</b> - The threat actor forwards ICMP echo request messages to many hosts. These messages contain the source IP address of the victim.
<br/>
2. <b>Reflection</b> - These hosts all reply to the spoofed IP address of the victim to overwhelm it.
</div>

**Note:** Newer forms of amplification and reflection attacks such as DNS-based reflection and amplification attacks and Network Time Protocol (NTP) amplification attacks are now being used.

Threat actors also use resource exhaustion attacks. These attacks consume the resources of a target host to either to crash it or to consume the resources of a network.
