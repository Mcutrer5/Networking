IP does not validate whether the source IP address contained in a packet actually came from that source. For this reason, threat actors can send packets using a spoofed source IP address. Threat actors can also tamper with the other fields in the IP header to carry out their attacks. Security analysts must understand the different fields in both the IPv4 and IPv6 headers.

Some of the more common IP related attacks are shown in the table.

| IP Attack Techniques                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| ICMP Attacks                         | Threat actors use Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo packets (pings) to discover subnets and hosts on a protected network to generate DoS flood attacks and to alter host routing tables.                                             |
| Amplification and reflection attacks | Threat actors attempt to prevent legitimate users from accessing information or services using DoS and DDoS attacks.                                                                                                                             |
| Address spoofing attacks             | Threat actors spoof the source IP address in an IP packet to perform blind spoofing or non-blind spoofing.                                                                                                                                       |
| Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM)      | Threat actors position themselves between a source and destination to transparently monitor, capture and control the communication. They could eavesdrop by inspecting captured or alter packets and forward them to their original destination. |
| Session hijacking                    | Threat actors gain access to the physical network and then use an MITM attack to hijack a session.                                                                                                                                               |
