tab: Adware
# **Adware**
• Adware is usually distributed by downloading online software.
• Adware can display unsolicited advertising using pop-up web browser windows, new toolbars, or unexpectedly redirect a webpage to a different website.
• Pop-up windows may be difficult to control as new windows can pop-up faster than the user can close them.

tab: Ransomware
# **Ransomware**
• Ransomware typically denies a user access to their files by encrypting the files and then displaying a message demanding a ransom for the decryption key.
• Users without up-to-date backups must pay the ransom to decrypt their files.
• Payment is usually made using wire transfer or crypt currencies such as bBitcoin.

tab: Rootkit
# **Rootkit**
• Rootkits are used by threat actors to gain administrator account-level access to a computer.
• They are very difficult to detect because they can alter firewall, antivirus protection, system files, and even OS commands to conceal their presence.
• They can provide a backdoor to threat actors giving them access to the PC and allowing them to upload files and install new software to be used in a DDoS attack.
• Special rootkit removal tools must be used to remove them or a complete OS re-install may be required.

tab: Spyware
# **Spyware**
• Similar to adware but used to gather information about the user and send to threat actors without the user's consent.
• Spyware can be a low threat, gathering browsing data, or it can be a high threat capturing personal and financial information.

tab: Worm
# **Worm**
• A worm is a self-replicating program that propagates automatically without user actions by exploiting vulnerabilities in legitimate software.
• It uses the network to search for other victims with the same vulnerability.
• The intent of a worm is usually to slow or disrupt network operations.
