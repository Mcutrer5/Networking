Cyber criminals now have the expertise and tools necessary to take down critical infrastructure and systems. Their tools and techniques continue to evolve.

Cyber criminals are taking malware to unprecedented levels of sophistication and impact. They are becoming more adept at using stealth and evasion techniques to hide their activity. Lastly, cyber criminals are exploiting undefended gaps in security.

Network security breaches can disrupt e-commerce, cause the loss of business data, threaten people’s privacy, and compromise the integrity of information. These breaches can result in lost revenue for corporations, theft of intellectual property, lawsuits, and can even threaten public safety.

Maintaining a secure network ensures the safety of network users and protects commercial interests. Organizations need individuals who can recognize the speed and scale at which adversaries are amassing and refining their cyber weaponry. All users should be aware of security terms in the table.

| **Security Terms** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Assets             | An asset is anything of value to the organization. It includes people, equipment, resources, and data                                                                                                                         |
| Vulnerability      | A vulnerability is a weakness in a system, or its design, that could be exploited by a threat.                                                                                                                                |
| Threat             | A threat is a potential danger to a company's assets, data, or network functionality                                                                                                                                          |
| Exploit            | An exploit is a mechanism that takes advantage of a vulnerability.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Mitigation         | Mitigation is the counter-measure that reduces the likelihood or severity of a potential threat or risk. Network security involves multiple mitigation techniques.                                                            |
| Risk               | Risk is the likelihood of a threat to exploit the vulnerability of an asset, with the aim of negatively affecting an organization. Risk is measured using the probability of the occurrence of an event and its consequences. |

Assets must be identified and protected. Vulnerabilities must be addressed before they become a threat and are exploited. Mitigation techniques are required before, during, and after an attack.
