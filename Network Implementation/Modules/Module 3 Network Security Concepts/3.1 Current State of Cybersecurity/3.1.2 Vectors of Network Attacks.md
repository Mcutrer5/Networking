An attack vector is a path by which a threat actor can gain access to a server, host, or network. Attack vectors originate from inside or outside the corporate network, as shown in the figure. For example, threat actors may target a network through the internet, to disrupt network operations and create a denial of service (DoS) attack.

# EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL THREATS

**Note:** A DoS attack occurs when a network device or application is incapacitated and no longer capable of supporting requests from legitimate users.

An internal user, such as an employee, can accidentally or intentionally:

- Steal and copy confidential data to removable media, email, messaging software, and other media.
- Compromise internal servers or network infrastructure devices.
- Disconnect a critical network connection and cause a network outage.
- Connect an infected USB drive into a corporate computer system.

Internal threats have the potential to cause greater damage than external threats because internal users have direct access to the building and its infrastructure devices. Employees may also have knowledge of the corporate network, its resources, and its confidential data.

Network security professionals must implement tools and apply techniques for mitigating both external and internal threats.
