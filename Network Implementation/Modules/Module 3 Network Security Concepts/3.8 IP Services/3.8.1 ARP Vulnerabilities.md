Earlier in this module you learned about vulnerabilities with IP, TCP and UDP. The TCP/IP protocol suite was never built for security. Therefore, the services that IP uses for addressing functions such as ARP, DNS, and DHCP, are also not secure, as you will learn in this topic.

Hosts broadcast an ARP Request to other hosts on the segment to determine the MAC address of a host with a particular IP address. All hosts on the subnet receive and process the ARP Request. The host with the matching IP address in the ARP Request sends an ARP Reply.

Click Play in the figure to see the ARP process at work.

### The ARP Process

Any client can send an unsolicited ARP Reply called a “gratuitous ARP.” This is often done when a device first boots up to inform all other devices on the local network of the new device’s MAC address. When a host sends a gratuitous ARP, other hosts on the subnet store the MAC address and IP address contained in the gratuitous ARP in their ARP tables.

This feature of ARP also means that any host can claim to be the owner of any IP or MAC. A threat actor can poison the ARP cache of devices on the local network, creating an MITM attack to redirect traffic. The goal is to target a victim host, and have it change its default gateway to the threat actor’s device. This positions the threat actor in between the victim and all other systems outside of the local subnet.
