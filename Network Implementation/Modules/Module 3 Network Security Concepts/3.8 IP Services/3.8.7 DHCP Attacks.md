**DHCP Spoofing Attack**

A DHCP spoofing attack occurs when a rogue DHCP server is connected to the network and provides false IP configuration parameters to legitimate clients. A rogue server can provide a variety of misleading information:

- **Wrong default gateway** - Threat actor provides an invalid gateway, or the IP address of its host to create a MITM attack. This may go entirely undetected as the intruder intercepts the data flow through the network.
- **Wrong DNS server** - Threat actor provides an incorrect DNS server address pointing the user to a malicious website.
- **Wrong IP address** - Threat actor provides an invalid IP address, invalid default gateway IP address, or both. The threat actor then creates a DoS attack on the DHCP client.

Assume a threat actor has successfully connected a rogue DHCP server to a switch port on the same subnet as the target clients. The goal of the rogue server is to provide clients with false IP configuration information.

tab: Client Broadcasts <br/>DHCP Discovery Messages

In the figure, a legitimate client connects to the network and requires IP configuration parameters. The client broadcasts a DHCP Discover request looking for a response from a DHCP server. Both servers receive the message.

tab: DHCP Servers <br/>Respond with Offers
The figure shows how the legitimate and rogue DHCP servers each respond with valid IP configuration parameters. The client replies to the first offer received.

tab: Client Accepts <br/>Rogue DHCP Request
In this scenario, the client received the rogue offer first. It broadcasts a DHCP request accepting the parameters from the rogue server, as shown in the figure. The legitimate and rogue server each receive the request.

tab: Rogue DHCP Acknowledges <br/>the Request
However, only the rogue server unicasts a reply to the client to acknowledge its request, as shown in the figure. The legitimate server stops communicating with the client because the request has already been acknowledged.
