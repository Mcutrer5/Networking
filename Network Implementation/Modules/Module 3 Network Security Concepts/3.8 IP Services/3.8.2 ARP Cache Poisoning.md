ARP cache poisoning can be used to launch various man-in-the-middle attacks.

tab: ARP Request
The figure shows how ARP cache poisoning works. PC-A requires the MAC address of its default gateway (R1); therefore, it sends an ARP Request for the MAC address of 192.168.10.1.

tab: ARP Reply
In this figure, R1 updates its ARP cache with the IP and MAC addresses of PC-A. R1 sends an ARP Reply to PC-A, which then updates its ARP cache with the IP and MAC addresses of R1.

tab: Spoofed Gratuitous ARP Replies
In the figure, the threat actor sends two spoofed gratuitous ARP Replies using its own MAC address for the indicated destination IP addresses. PC-A updates its ARP cache with its default gateway which is now pointing to the threat actor’s host MAC address. R1 also updates its ARP cache with the IP address of PC-A pointing to the threat actor’s MAC address.

The threat actor’s host is executing an ARP poisoning attack. The ARP poisoning attack can be passive or active. Passive ARP poisoning is where threat actors steal confidential information. Active ARP poisoning is where threat actors modify data in transit, or inject malicious data.

**Note:** There are many tools available on the internet to create ARP MITM attacks including dsniff, Cain & Abel, ettercap, Yersinia, and others.
