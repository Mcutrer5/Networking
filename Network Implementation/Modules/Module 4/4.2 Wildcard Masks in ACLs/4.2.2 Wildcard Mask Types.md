Using wildcard masks will take some practice. Refer to the examples to learn how the wildcard mask is used to filter traffic for one host, one subnet, and a range IPv4 addresses.

**Wildcard to Match a Host**

In this example, the wildcard mask is used to match a specific host IPv4 address. Assume ACL 10 needs an ACE that only permits the host with IPv4 address 192.168.1.1. Recall that “0” equals a match and “1” equals ignore. To match a specific host IPv4 address, a wildcard mask consisting of all zeroes (i.e., 0.0.0.0) is required.

The table lists in binary, the host IPv4 address, the wildcard mask, and the permitted IPv4 address.

The 0.0.0.0 wildcard mask stipulates that every bit must match exactly. Therefore, when the ACE is processed, the wildcard mask will permit only the 192.168.1.1 address. The resulting ACE in ACL 10 would be **access-list 10 permit 192.168.1.1 0.0.0.0.**

| IPv4 address | `192.168.1.1` | `11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001` |
| Wildcard Mask | `0.0.0.0` | `00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000` |
