In a previous topic, you learned about how wildcard masks are used in ACLs. This topic will focus on the guidelines for ACL creation. There is a limit on the number of ACLs that can be applied on a router interface. For example, a dual-stacked (i.e., IPv4 and IPv6) router interface can have up to four ACLs applied, as shown in the figure.

Specifically, a router interface can have:

- one outbound IPv4 ACL
- one inbound IPv4 ACL
- one inbound IPv6 ACL
- one outbound IPv6 ACL

Assume R1 has two dual-stacked interfaces that require inbound and outbound IPv4 and IPv6 ACLs applied. As shown in the figure, R1 could have up to 8 ACLs configured and applied to interfaces. Each interface would have four ACLs; two ACLs for IPv4 and two ACLs for IPv6. For each protocol, one ACL is for inbound traffic and one for outbound traffic.

**Note:** ACLs do not have to be configured in both directions. The number of ACLs and their direction applied to the interface will depend on the security policy of the organization.
