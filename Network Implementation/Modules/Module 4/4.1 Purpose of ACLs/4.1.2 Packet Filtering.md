Cisco routers support two types of ACLs:

- **Standard ACLs** - ACLs only filter at Layer 3 using the source IPv4 address only.
- **Extended ACLs** - ACLs filter at Layer 3 using the source and / or destination IPv4 address. They can also filter at Layer 4 using TCP, UDP ports, and optional protocol type information for finer control.
