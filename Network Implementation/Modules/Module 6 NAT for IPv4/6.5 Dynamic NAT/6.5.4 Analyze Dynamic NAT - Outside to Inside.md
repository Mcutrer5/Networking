The figure below illustrates the remainder of the traffic flow between the clients and the server from the outside to the inside direction.

4. The server receives the packet from PC1 and responds using the IPv4 destination address of 209.165.200.226. When the server receives the second packet, it responds to PC2 using the IPv4 destination address of 209.165.200.227. <br/>
5. (a) When R2 receives the packet with the destination IPv4 address of 209.165.200.226; it performs a NAT table lookup. Using the mapping from the table, R2 translates the address back to the inside local address 192.168.10.10 and forwards the packet toward PC1. <br/> 
    (b) When R2 receives the packet with the destination IPv4 address of 209.165.200.227; it performs a NAT table lookup. Using the mapping from the table, R2 translates the address back to the inside local address 192.168.11.10 and forwards the packet toward PC2. <br/>
6. PC1 at 192.168.10.10 and PC2 at 192.168.11.10 receive the packets and continue the conversation. The router performs Steps 2 to 5 for each packet. (Step 6 is not shown in the figures.)
