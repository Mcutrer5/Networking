Using the previous configuration, the next two figures illustrate the dynamic NAT translation process between two clients and the web server.

1. The hosts with the source IPv4 addresses of 192.168.10.10 (PC1) and 192.168.11.10 (PC2) send packets requesting a connection to the server at the public IPv4 address 209.165.200.254. <br/>
2. R2 receives the first packet from host 192.168.10.10. Because this packet was received on an interface configured as an inside NAT interface, R2 checks the NAT configuration to determine if this packet should be translated. The ACL permits this packet, so R2 will translate the packet. R2 checks its NAT table. Because there is no current translation entry for this IPv4 address, R2 determines that the source address 192.168.10.10 must be translated. R2 selects an available global address from the dynamic address pool and creates a translation entry, 209.165.200.226. The original source IPv4 address 192.168.10.10 is the inside local address and the translated address is the inside global address 209.165.200.226 in the NAT table. For the second host, 192.168.11.10, R2 repeats the procedure, selects the next available global address from the dynamic address pool, and creates a second translation entry, 209.165.200.227.<br/>
3. R2 replaces the inside local source address of PC1, 192.168.10.10, with the translated inside global address of 209.165.200.226 and forwards the packet. The same process occurs for the packet from PC2 using the translated address of 209.165.200.227.
