The table provides a summary of the differences between NAT and PAT.

|NAT|PAT|
|---|---|
|One-to-one mapping between Inside Local and Inside Global addresses.|One Inside Global address can be mapped to many Inside Local addresses.|
|Uses only IPv4 addresses in translation process.|Uses IPv4 addresses and TCP or UDP source port numbers in translation process.|
|A unique Inside Global address is required for each inside host accessing the outside network.|A single unique Inside Global address can be shared by many inside hosts accessing the outside network.|

The figure shows a simple example of a NAT table. In this example, four hosts on the internal network are communicating to the outside network. The left column lists the addresses in the global address pool that are used by NAT to translate the Inside Local address of each host. Note the one-to-one relationship of Inside Global addresses to Inside Local addresses for each of the four hosts accessing the outside network. With NAT, an Inside Global address is needed for each host that needs to connect to the outside network.
<br/>

**Note**: NAT forwards the incoming return packets to the original inside host by referring to the table and translating the Inside Global address back to the corresponding Inside Local address of the host.

tab: PAT
**PAT**
<br/><br/>

While NAT only modifies the IPv4 addresses, PAT modifies both the IPv4 address and the port number. With PAT, there is generally only one, or very few, publicly exposed IPv4 addresses. The example NAT table shows one Inside Global address being used to translate the Inside Local addresses of the four inside hosts. PAT uses the Layer 4 port number to track the conversations of the four hosts.
