Because many networks use both IPv4 and IPv6, there needs to be a way to use IPv6 with NAT. This topic discusses how IPv6 can be integrated with NAT. IPv6, with a 128-bit address, provides 340 undecillion addresses. Therefore, address space is not an issue. IPv6 was developed with the intention of making NAT for IPv4 with translation between public and private IPv4 addresses unnecessary. However, IPv6 does include its own IPv6 private address space, unique local addresses (ULAs).

IPv6 unique local addresses (ULA) are similar to RFC 1918 private addresses in IPv4 but have a different purpose. ULA addresses are meant for only local communications within a site. ULA addresses are not meant to provide additional IPv6 address space, nor to provide a level of security.

IPv6 does provide for protocol translation between IPv4 and IPv6 known as NAT64.
