Router R2 has been configured to provide PAT to the 192.168.0.0/16 clients. When the internal hosts exit router R2 to the internet, they are translated to an IPv4 address from the PAT pool with a unique source port number.

The same commands used to verify static and dynamic NAT are used to verify PAT, as shown in the example output. The **show ip nat translations** command displays the translations from two different hosts to different web servers. Notice that two different inside hosts are allocated the same IPv4 address of 209.165.200.226 (inside global address). The source port numbers in the NAT table differentiate the two transactions.

```
R2# show ip nat translations
Pro Inside global          Inside local         Outside local      Outside global
tcp 209.165.200.225:1444  192.168.10.10:1444  209.165.201.1:80   209.165.201.1:80
tcp 209.165.200.225:1445  192.168.11.10:1444  209.165.202.129:80 209.165.202.129:80
R2#
```

In the next example, the **show ip nat statistics** command verifies that NAT-POOL2 has allocated a single address for both translations. Included in the output is information about the number and type of active translations, NAT configuration parameters, the number of addresses in the pool, and how many have been allocated.

```
R2# show ip nat statistics
