In this topic, you will learn how to configure and verify PAT. It includes a Packet Tracer activity to test your skills and knowledge. There are two ways to configure PAT, depending on how the ISP allocates public IPv4 addresses. In the first instance, the ISP allocates a single public IPv4 address that is required for the organization to connect to the ISP and in the other, it allocates more than one public IPv4 address to the organization.

Both methods will be demonstrated using the scenario shown in the figure.
