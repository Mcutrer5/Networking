To configure PAT to use a single IPv4 address, simply add the keyword **overload** to the **ip nat inside source** command. The rest of the configuration is the similar to static and dynamic NAT configuration except that with PAT, multiple hosts can use the same public IPv4 address to access the internet.

In the example, all hosts from network 192.168.0.0/16 (matching ACL 1) that send traffic through router R2 to the internet will be translated to IPv4 address 209.165.200.225 (IPv4 address of interface S0/1/1). The traffic flows will be identified by port numbers in the NAT table because the **overload** keyword is configured.

```
R2(config)# ip nat inside source list 1 interface serial 0/1/0 **overload
R2(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255
R2(config)# interface serial0/1/0
R2(config-if)# ip nat inside
R2(config-if)# exit
R2(config)# interface Serial0/1/1
R2(config-if)# ip nat outside
```
