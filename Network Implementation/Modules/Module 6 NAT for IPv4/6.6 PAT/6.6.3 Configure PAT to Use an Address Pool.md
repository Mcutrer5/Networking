An ISP may allocate more than one public IPv4 address to an organization. In this scenario the organization can configure PAT to use a pool of IPv4 public addresses for translation.

If a site has been issued more than one public IPv4 address, these addresses can be part of a pool that is used by PAT. The small pool of addresses is shared among a larger number of devices, with multiple hosts using the same public IPv4 address to access the internet. To configure PAT for a dynamic NAT address pool, simply add the keyword **overload** to the **ip nat inside source** command.

The topology for this scenario is repeated in the figure for your convenience.

In the example, NAT-POOL2 is bound to an ACL to permit 192.168.0.0/16 to be translated. These hosts can share an IPv4 address from the pool because PAT is enabled with the keyword **overload**.

```
R2(config)# ip nat pool NAT-POOL2 209.165.200.226 209.165.200.240 netmask 255.255.255.224
R2(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255
R2(config)# ip nat inside source list 1 pool NAT-POOL2 overload
R2(config)# interface serial0/1/0
R2(config-if)# ip nat inside
R2(config)# interface serial0/1/0
R2(config-if)# ip nat outside
```
