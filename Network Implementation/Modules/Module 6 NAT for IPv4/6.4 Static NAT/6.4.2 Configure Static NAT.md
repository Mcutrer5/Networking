There are two basic tasks when configuring static NAT translations:

**Step 1**. The first task is to create a mapping between the inside local address and the inside global addresses. For example, the 192.168.10.254 inside local address and the 209.165.201.5 inside global address in the figure are configured as a static NAT translation.

```
R2(config)# ip nat inside source static 192.168.10.254 209.165.201.5
```

**Step 2**. After the mapping is configured, the interfaces participating in the translation are configured as inside or outside relative to NAT. In the example, the R2 Serial 0/1/0 interface is an inside interface and Serial 0/1/1 is an outside interface.

```
R2(config)# interface serial 0/1/0
R2(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.252
R2(config-if)# ip nat inside
R2(config-if)# exit
R2(config)# interface serial 0/1/1
R2(config-if)# ip address 209.165.200.1 255.255.255.252
R2(config-if)# ip nat outside
```

With this configuration in place, packets arriving on the inside interface of R2 (Serial 0/1/0) from the configured inside local IPv4 address (192.168.10.254) are translated and then forwarded towards the outside network. Packets arriving on the outside interface of R2 (Serial 0/1/1), that are addressed to the configured inside global IPv4 address (209.165.201.5), are translated to the inside local address (192.168.10.254) and then forwarded to the inside network.
