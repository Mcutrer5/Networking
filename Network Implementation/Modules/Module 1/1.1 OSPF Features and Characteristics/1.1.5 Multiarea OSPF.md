With multiarea OSPF, one large routing domain can be divided into smaller areas, to support hierarchical routing. Routing still occurs between the areas (interarea routing), while many of the processor intensive routing operations, such as recalculating the database, are kept within an area.

For instance, any time a router receives new information about a topology change within the area (including the addition, deletion, or modification of a link) the router must rerun the SPF algorithm, create a new SPF tree, and update the routing table. The SPF algorithm is CPU-intensive and the time it takes for calculation depends on the size of the area.

**Note:** Routers in other areas receive updates regarding topology changes, but these routers only update the routing table, not rerun the SPF algorithm.

Too many routers in one area would make the LSDBs very large and increase the load on the CPU. Therefore, arranging routers into areas effectively partitions a potentially large database into smaller and more manageable databases.

The hierarchical-topology design options with multiarea OSPF can offer the following advantages.

- **Smaller routing tables** - Tables are smaller because there are fewer routing table entries. This is because network addresses can be summarized between areas. Route summarization is not enabled by default.
- **Reduced link-state update overhead** - Designing multiarea OSPF with smaller areas minimizes processing and memory requirements.
- **Reduced frequency of SPF calculations** - Multiarea OSPF localize the impact of a topology change within an area. For instance, it minimizes routing update impact because LSA flooding stops at the area boundary.

For example, in the figure R2 is an ABR for area 51. A topology change in area 51 would cause all area 51 routers to rerun the SPF algorithm, create a new SPF tree and update their IP routing tables. The ABR, R2, would send an LSA to routers in the area 0, which would eventually be flooded to all routers in the OSPF routing domain. This type of LSA does not cause routers in other areas to rerun the SPF algorithm. They only have to update their LSDB and routing table.

### **Link Change Impacts Local Area Only**

- *Link failure affects the local area only (area 51).*
- *The ABR (R2) isolates the flooding of a specific LSA to area 51.*
- *Routers in areas 0 and 1 do not need to run the SPF algorithm.*
