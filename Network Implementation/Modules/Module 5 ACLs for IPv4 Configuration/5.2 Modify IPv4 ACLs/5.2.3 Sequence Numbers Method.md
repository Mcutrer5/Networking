An ACL ACE can also be deleted or added using the ACL sequence numbers. Sequence numbers are automatically assigned when an ACE is entered. These numbers are listed in the **show access-lists** command. The **show running-config** command does not display sequence numbers.

In the previous example, the incorrect ACE for ACL 1 is using sequence number 10, as shown in the example.

```
R1# show access-lists
Standard IP access list 1
    10 deny   19.168.10.10
    20 permit 192.168.10.0, wildcard bits 0.0.0.255
R1#
```

Use the **ip access-list standard** command to edit an ACL. Statements cannot be overwritten using the same sequence number as an existing statement. Therefore, the current statement must be deleted first with the **no 10** command. Then the correct ACE can be added using sequence number 10 is configured. Verify the changes using the **show access-lists** command, as shown in the example.

```
R1# **conf t**
R1(config)# **ip access-list standard 1**
R1(config-std-nacl)# **no 10**
R1(config-std-nacl)# **10 deny host 192.168.10.10**
R1(config-std-nacl)# **end**
R1# **show access-lists**
Standard IP access list 1
    10 deny   192.168.10.10
    20 permit 192.168.10.0, wildcard bits 0.0.0.255
R1#
```
