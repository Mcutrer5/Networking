Named ACLs can also use sequence numbers to delete and add ACEs. Refer to the example for ACL **NO-ACCESS.**

```
R1# **show access-lists**
Standard IP access list NO-ACCESS
    10 deny   192.168.10.10
    20 permit 192.168.10.0, wildcard bits 0.0.0.255
```

Assume that host 192.168.10.5 from the 192.168.10.0/24 network should also have been denied. If you entered a new ACE, it would be appended to the end of the ACL. Therefore, the host would never be denied because ACE 20 permits all hosts from that network.

The solution is to add an ACE denying host 192.168.10.5 in between ACE 10 and ACE 20, such as ACE 15, as shown in the example. Also notice that the new ACE was entered without using the **host** keyword. The keyword is optional when specifying a destination host.

Use the **show access-lists** command to verify the ACL now has a new ACE 15 inserted appropriately before the permit statement.

Notice that sequence number 15 is displayed prior to sequence number 10. We might expect the order of the statements in the output to reflect the order in which they were entered. However, the IOS puts host statements in an order using a special hashing function. The resulting order optimizes the search for a host ACL entry and then it searches for range statements.

**Note**: The hashing function is only applied to host statements in an IPv4 standard access list. The details of the hashing function are beyond the scope of this course.

```
R1# **configure terminal**
R1(config)# **ip access-list standard NO-ACCESS**
R1(config-std-nacl)# **15 deny 192.168.10.5**
R1(config-std-nacl)# **end**
R1#
R1# **show access-lists**
Standard IP access list NO-ACCESS
    15 deny   192.168.10.5
    10 deny   192.168.10.10
    20 permit 192.168.10.0, wildcard bits 0.0.0.255
R1#
