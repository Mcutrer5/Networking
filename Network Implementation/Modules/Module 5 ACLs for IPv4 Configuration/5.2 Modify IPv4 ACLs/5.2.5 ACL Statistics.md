Notice that the **show access-lists** command in the example shows statistics for each statement that has been matched. The deny ACE in the NO-ACCESS ACL has been matched 20 times and the permit ACE has been matched 64 times.

Note that the implied deny any the last statement does not display any statistics. To track how many implicit denied packets have been matched, you must manually configure the **deny any** command at the end of the ACL.

Use the **clear access-list counters** command to clear the ACL statistics. This command can be used alone or with the number or name of a specific ACL.

```
R1# **show access-lists**
Standard IP access list NO-ACCESS
    10 deny   192.168.10.10  (20 matches) 
    20 permit 192.168.10.0, wildcard bits 0.0.0.255  (64 matches) 
R1# **clear access-list counters NO-ACCESS**
R1# **show access-lists**
Standard IP access list NO-ACCESS
    10 deny   192.168.10.10
    20 permit 192.168.10.0, wildcard bits 0.0.0.255
R1#
```
