ACLs with multiple ACEs should be created in a text editor. This allows you to plan the required ACEs, create the ACL, and then paste it into the router interface. It also simplifies the tasks to edit and fix an ACL.

For example, assume ACL 1 was entered incorrectly using **19** instead of **192** for the first octet, as shown in the running configuration.

```
R1# show run | section access-list 
access-list 1 deny 19.168.10.10
access-list 1 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255
R1#
```

In the example, the first ACE should have been to deny the host at 192.168.10.10. However, the ACE was incorrectly entered.

To correct the error:

- Copy the ACL from the running configuration and paste it into the text editor.
- Make the necessary edits changes.
- Remove the previously configured ACL on the router otherwise, pasting the edited ACL commands will only append (i.e., add) to the existing ACL ACEs on the router.
- Copy and paste the edited ACL back to the router.

Assume that ACL 1 has now been corrected. Therefore, the incorrect ACL must be deleted, and the corrected ACL 1 statements must be pasted in global configuration mode, as shown in the output.

```
R1(config)# no access-list 1
R1(config)#
R1(config)# access-list 1 deny 192.168.10.10
R1(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255
R1(config)#
```
