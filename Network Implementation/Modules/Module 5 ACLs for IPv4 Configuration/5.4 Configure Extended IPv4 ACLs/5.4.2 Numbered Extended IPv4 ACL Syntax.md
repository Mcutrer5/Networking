The procedural steps for configuring extended ACLs are the same as for standard ACLs. The extended ACL is first configured, and then it is activated on an interface. However, the command syntax and parameters are more complex to support the additional features provided by extended ACLs.

To create a numbered extended ACL, use the following global configuration command:

```
Router(config)# access-list access-list-number {deny | permit | remark text} protocol source source-wildcard [operator {port}] destination destination-wildcard [operator {port}] [established] [log]
```

Use the **no ip access-list** **extended** _access-list-name_ global configuration command to remove an extended ACL.

Although there are many keywords and parameters for extended ACLs, it is not necessary to use all of them when configuring an extended ACL. The table provides a detailed explanation of the syntax for an extended ACL.

|**Parameter**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`_access-list-number_`|- This is the decimal number of the ACL.<br>- Extended ACL number range is 100 to 199 and 2000 to 2699.|
|`**deny**`|This denies access if the condition is matched.|
|`**permit**`|This permits access if the condition is matched.|
|`**remark** text`|- (Optional) Adds a text entry for documentation purposes.<br>- Each remark is limited to 100 characters.|
|`_protocol_`|- Name or number of an internet protocol.<br>- Common keywords include **ip**, **tcp**, **udp**, and **icmp**.<br>- The **ip** keyword matches all IP protocols.|
|`_source_`|- This identifies the source network or host address to filter.<br>- Use the **any** keyword to specify all networks.<br>- Use the **host** _ip-address_ keyword or simply enter an _ip-address_ (without the **host** keyword) to identify a specific IP address.|
|`_source-wildcard_`|(Optional) A 32-bit wildcard mask that is applied to the source.|
|`_destination_`|- This identifies the destination network or host address to filter.<br>- Use the **any** keyword to specify all networks.<br>- Use the **host** _ip-address_ keyword or _ip-address_.|
|`_destination-wildcard_`|(Optional) This is a 32-bit wildcard mask that is applied to the destination.|
|`_operator_`|- (Optional) This compares source or destination ports.<br>- Possible operands include **It** (less than), **gt** (greater than), **eq** (equal), **neq** (not equal), and **range** (inclusive range).|
|`_port_`|(Optional) The decimal number or name of a TCP or UDP port.|
|`**established**`|- (Optional) For the TCP protocol only.<br>- This is a 1st generation firewall feature.|
|`**log**`|- (Optional) This keyword generates and sends an informational message whenever the ACE is matched.<br>- This message includes ACL number, matched condition (i.e., permitted or denied), source address, and number of packets.<br>- This message is generated for the first matched packet.<br>- This keyword should only be implemented for troubleshooting or security reasons.|

The command to apply an extended IPv4 ACL to an interface is the same as the command used for standard IPv4 ACLs.

```
Router(config-if)# ip access-group {access-list-number | access-list-name} {in | out}
```

To remove an ACL from an interface, first enter the **no ip access-group** interface configuration command. To remove the ACL from the router, use the **no access-list** global configuration command.

**Note:** The internal logic applied to the ordering of standard ACL statements does not apply to extended ACLs. The order in which the statements are entered during configuration is the order they are displayed and processed.
