In the previous topics, you learned about how to configure and modify standard ACLs, and how to secure VTY ports with a standard IPv4 ACL. Standard ACLs only filter on source address. When more precise traffic-filtering control is required, extended IPv4 ACLs can be created.

Extended ACLs are used more often than standard ACLs because they provide a greater degree of control. They can filter on source address, destination address, protocol (i.e., IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP), and port number. This provides a greater range of criteria on which to base the ACL. For example, one extended ACL can allow email traffic from a network to a specific destination while denying file transfers and web browsing.

Like standard ACLs, extended ACLs can be created as:

- **Numbered Extended ACL** - Created using the **access-list** _access-list-number_ global configuration command.
- **Named Extended ACL** - Created using the **ip access-list extended** _access-list-name_.
