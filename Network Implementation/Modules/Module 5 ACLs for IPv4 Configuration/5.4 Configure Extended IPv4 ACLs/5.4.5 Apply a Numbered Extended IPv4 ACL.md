The topology in the figure will be used to demonstrate configuring and applying numbered and named extended IPv4 ACLs to an interface. This first example shows a numbered extended IPv4 ACL implementation.

![[5.4.5.png]]

In this example, the ACL permits both HTTP and HTTPS traffic from the 192.168.10.0 network to go to any destination.

Extended ACLs can be applied in various locations. However, they are commonly applied close to the source. Therefore, ACL 110 was applied inbound on the R1 G0/0/0 interface.

```
R1(config)# access-list 110 permit tcp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any eq www
R1(config)# access-list 110 permit tcp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 443
R1(config)# interface g0/0/0
R1(config-if)# ip access-group 110 in
R1(config-if)# exit
R1(config)#
```
