Naming an ACL makes it easier to understand its function. To create a named extended ACL, use the following global configuration command:

```
Router(config)# ip access-list extended access-list-name
```

This command enters the named extended configuration mode. Recall that ACL names are alphanumeric, case sensitive, and must be unique.

In the example, a named extended ACL called NO-FTP-ACCESS is created and the prompt changed to named extended ACL configuration mode. ACE statements are entered in the named extended ACL sub configuration mode.

```
R1(config)# ip access-list extended NO-FTP-ACCESS
R1(config-ext-nacl)# 
```
