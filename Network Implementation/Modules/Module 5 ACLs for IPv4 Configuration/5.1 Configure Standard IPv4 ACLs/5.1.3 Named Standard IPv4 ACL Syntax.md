Naming an ACL makes it easier to understand its function. To create a named standard ACL, use the following global configuration command:

```
Router(config)# ip access-list standard access-list-name
```

This command enters the named standard configuration mode where you configure the ACL ACEs.

ACL names are alphanumeric, case sensitive, and must be unique. Capitalizing ACL names is not required but makes them stand out when viewing the running-config output. It also makes it less likely that you will accidentally create two different ACLs with the same name but with different uses of capitalization.

**Note:** Use the **no ip access-list** **standard** _access-list-name_ global configuration command to remove a named standard IPv4 ACL.

In the example, a named standard IPv4 ACL called NO-ACCESS is created. Notice that the prompt changes to named standard ACL configuration mode. ACE statements are entered in the named standard ACL sub configuration mode. Use the help facility to view all the named standard ACL ACE options.

The three highlighted options are configured similar to the numbered standard ACL. Unlike the numbered ACL method, there is no need to repeat the initial **ip access-list** command for each ACE.

```
R1(config)# ip access-list standard NO-ACCESS
R1(config-std-nacl)# ?
