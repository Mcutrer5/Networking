After a standard IPv4 ACL is configured, it must be linked to an interface or feature. The following command can be used to bind a numbered or named standard IPv4 ACL to an interface:

```
Router(config-if) # ip access-group {access-list-number | access-list-name} {in | out}
```

To remove an ACL from an interface, first enter the **no ip access-group** interface configuration command. However, the ACL will still be configured on the router. To remove the ACL from the router, use the **no access-list** global configuration command.
