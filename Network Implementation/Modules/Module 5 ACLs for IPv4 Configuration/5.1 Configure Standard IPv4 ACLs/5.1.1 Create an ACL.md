In a previous module, you learned about what an ACL does and why it is important. In this topic, you will learn about creating ACLs.

All access control lists (ACLs) must be planned. However, this is especially true for ACLs requiring multiple access control entries (ACEs).

When configuring a complex ACL, it is suggested that you:

- Use a text editor and write out the specifics of the policy to be implemented.
- Add the IOS configuration commands to accomplish those tasks.
- Include remarks to document the ACL.
- Copy and paste the commands onto the device.
- Always thoroughly test an ACL to ensure that it correctly applies the desired policy.

These recommendations enable you to create the ACL thoughtfully without impacting the traffic on the network.
