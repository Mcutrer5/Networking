This second example shows a named standard IPv4 ACL implementation. The topology is repeated in the figure for your convenience.

![[5.1.6.png]]

Assume only PC1 is allowed out to the internet. To enable this policy, a named standard ACL called PERMIT-ACCESS could be applied outbound on S0/1/0.

Remove the previously configured named ACL 10 and create a named standard ACL called PERMIT-ACCESS, as shown here.

```
R1(config)# no access-list 10
R1(config)# ip access-list standard PERMIT-ACCESS
R1(config-std-nacl)# remark ACE permits host 192.168.10.10
R1(config-std-nacl)# permit host 192.168.10.10
R1(config-std-nacl)#
```

Now add an ACE permitting only host 192.168.10.10 and another ACE permitting all LAN 2 hosts to the internet.

```
R1(config-std-nacl)# remark ACE permits host 192.168.10.10
R1(config-std-nacl)# permit host 192.168.10.10
R1(config-std-nacl)# remark ACE permits all hosts in LAN 2
R1(config-std-nacl)# permit 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255
R1(config-std-nacl)# exit
R1(config)#
```

Use the **show access-lists** and **show running-config** command to review the ACL in the configuration, as shown in the output.

```
R1# show access-lists
Standard IP access list PERMIT-ACCESS    
	10 permit 192.168.10.10    
	20 permit 192.168.20.0, wildcard bits 0.0.0.255
R1# show run | section ip access-list
ip access-list standard PERMIT-ACCESS 
remark ACE permits host 192.168.10.10 
permit 192.168.10.10 
remark ACE permits all hosts in LAN 2 
permit 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255
R1#
```

Finally, use the **show ip interface** command to verify if an interface has an ACL applied to it. In the example output, the output is specifically looking at the Serial 0/1/0 interface for lines that include “access list” text.

```
R1# show ip int Serial 0/1/0 | include access list  
	Outgoing Common access list is not set  
	Outgoing access list is PERMIT-ACCESS  
	Inbound Common access list is not set  
	Inbound  access list is not set
R1#
```
