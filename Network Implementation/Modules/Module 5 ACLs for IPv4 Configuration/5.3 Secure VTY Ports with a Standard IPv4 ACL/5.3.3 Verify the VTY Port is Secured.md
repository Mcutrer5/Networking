After the ACL to restrict access to the vty lines is configured, it is important to verify that it is working as expected.

As shown in the figure, when PC1 Telnets to R1, the host will be prompted for a username and password before successfully accessing the command prompt.

This verifies that PC1 can access R1 for administrative purposes.

Next, we test the connection from PC2. As shown in this figure, when PC2 attempts to Telnet, the connection is refused.

To verify the ACL statistics, issue the **show access-lists** command. Notice the informational message displayed on the console regarding the admin user. An informational console message is also generated when a user exits the vty line.

The match in the permit line of the output is a result of a successful Telnet connection by PC1. The match in the deny statement is due to the failed attempt to create a Telnet connection by PC2, a device on the 192.168.11.0/24 network.
