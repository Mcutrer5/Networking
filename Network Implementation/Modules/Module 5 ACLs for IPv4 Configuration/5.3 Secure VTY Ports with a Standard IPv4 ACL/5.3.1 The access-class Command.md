ACLs typically filter incoming or outgoing traffic on an interface. However, an ACL can also be used to secure remote administrative access to a device using the vty lines.

Use the following two steps to secure remote administrative access to the vty lines:

- Create an ACL to identify which administrative hosts should be allowed remote access.
- Apply the ACL to incoming traffic on the vty lines.

Use the following command to apply an ACL to the vty lines:

```
R1(config-line)# access-class {access-list-number | access-list-name} { in | out } 
```

The **in** keyword is the most commonly used option to filter incoming vty traffic. The **out** parameter filters outgoing vty traffic and is rarely applied.

The following should be considered when configuring access lists on vty lines:

- Both named and numbered access lists can be applied to vty lines.
- ==Identical restrictions should be set on all the vty lines==, because a user can attempt to connect to any of them.
