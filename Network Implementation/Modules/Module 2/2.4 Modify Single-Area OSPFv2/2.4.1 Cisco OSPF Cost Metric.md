Recall that a routing protocol uses a metric to determine the best path of a packet across a network. A metric gives indication of the overhead that is required to send packets across a certain interface. OSPF uses cost as a metric. A lower cost indicates a better path than a higher cost.

The Cisco cost of an interface is inversely proportional to the bandwidth of the interface. Therefore, a higher bandwidth indicates a lower cost. The formula used to calculate the OSPF cost is:

**Cost = reference bandwidth / interface bandwidth**

The default reference bandwidth is 108 (100,000,000); therefore, the formula is:

**Cost = 100,000,000 bps / interface bandwidth in bps**

Refer to the table for a breakdown of the cost calculation. Because the OSPF cost value must be an integer, FastEthernet, Gigabit Ethernet, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10 GigE) interfaces share the same cost. To correct this situation, you can:

- Adjust the reference bandwidth with the **auto-cost reference-bandwidth** command on each OSPF router.
- Manually set the OSPF cost value with the **ip ospf cost** command on necessary interfaces.
