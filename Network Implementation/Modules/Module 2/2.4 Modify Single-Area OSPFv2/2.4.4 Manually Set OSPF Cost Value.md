OSPF cost values can be manipulated to influence the route chosen by OSPF. For example, in the current configuration, R1 is load balancing to the 10.1.1.8/30 network. It will send some traffic to R2 and some traffic to R3. You can see this in the routing table.

```
R1# show ip route ospf | begin 10      
	10.0.0.0/8 is variably subnetted, 9 subnets, 3 masks
O        10.1.1.8/30 [110/20] via 10.1.1.13, 00:54:50, GigabitEthernet0/0/1                     
					 [110/20] via 10.1.1.6, 00:55:14, GigabitEthernet0/0/0
(output omitted)
R1#
```

**Note:** Changing the cost of link may have undesired consequences. Therefore, adjusting interface cost values should only be configured when the outcome is fully understood.

The administrator may want traffic to go through R2 and use R3 as a backup route in case the link between R1 and R2 goes down.

Another reason to change the cost value is because other vendors may calculate OSPF in a different manner. By manipulating the cost value, the administrator can make sure the route costs shared between OSPF multivendor routers are accurately reflected in routing tables.

To change the cost value reported by the local OSPF router to other OSPF routers, use the interface configuration command **ip ospf cost** _value_. In the figure, we need to change cost of the loopback interfaces to 10 to simulate Gigabit Ethernet speeds. In addition, we will change the cost of the link between R2 and R3 to 30 so that this link is used as a backup link.

The following example is the configuration for R1.

```
R1(config)# interface g0/0/1
R1(config-if)# ip ospf cost 30
R1(config-if)# interface lo0
R1(config-if)# ip ospf cost 10
R1(config-if)# end
R1#
```

Assuming OSPF costs for R2 and R3 have been configured to match the topology in the above figure, the OSPF routes for R1 would have the following cost values. Notice that R1 is no longer load balancing to the 10.1.1.8/30 network. In fact, all routes go through R2 via 10.1.1.6, as desired by the network administrator.

```
R1# show ip route ospf | begin 10      
		10.0.0.0/8 is variably subnetted, 9 subnets, 3 masks
O        10.1.1.8/30 [110/20] via 10.1.1.6, 01:18:25, GigabitEthernet0/0/0
O        10.10.2.0/24 [110/20] via 10.1.1.6, 00:04:31, GigabitEthernet0/0/0
O        10.10.3.0/24 [110/30] via 10.1.1.6, 00:03:21, GigabitEthernet0/0/0
R1#
```

**Note:** Although using the **ip ospf cost** command is the recommended method to manipulate the OSPF cost values, an administrator could also do this by using the interface configuration **bandwidth** _kbps_ command. However, that would only work if all the routers are Cisco routers.
