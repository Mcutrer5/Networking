An OSPF router ID is a 32-bit value, represented as an IPv4 address. The router ID is used to uniquely identify an OSPF router. All OSPF packets include the router ID of the originating router. Every router requires a router ID to participate in an OSPF domain. The router ID can be defined by an administrator or automatically assigned by the router. The router ID is used by an OSPF-enabled router to do the following:

- **Participate in the synchronization of OSPF databases** - During the Exchange State, the router with the highest router ID will send their database descriptor (DBD) packets first.
- **Participate in the election of the designated router (DR)** - In a multiaccess LAN environment, the router with the highest router ID is elected the DR. The routing device with the second highest router ID is elected the backup designated router (BDR).

**Note:** The DR and BDR election process is discussed in more detail later in this module.
