Use the **passive-interface** router configuration mode command to prevent the transmission of routing messages through a router interface, but still allow that network to be advertised to other routers. The configuration example identifies the R1 Loopback 0/0/0 interface as passive.

**Note:** The loopback interface in this example is representing an Ethernet network. In production networks, loopback interfaces do not require to be passive.

The **show ip protocols** command is then used to verify that the Loopback 0 interface is listed as passive. The interface is still listed under the heading, “Routing on Interfaces Configured Explicitly (Area 0)”, which means that this network is still included as a route entry in OSPFv2 updates that are sent to R2 and R3.

```terminal
R1(config)# router ospf 10
R1(config-router)# passive-interface loopback 0
R1(config-router)# end
