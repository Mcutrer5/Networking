By default, OSPF messages are forwarded out all OSPF-enabled interfaces. However, these messages really only need to be sent out interfaces that are connecting to other OSPF-enabled routers.

Refer to the topology in the figure. OSPFv2 messages are forwarded out the three loopback interfaces even though no OSPFv2 neighbor exists on these simulated LANs. In a production network, these loopbacks would be physical interfaces to networks with users and traffic. Sending out unneeded messages on a LAN affects the network in three ways, as follows:

- **Inefficient Use of Bandwidth** - Available bandwidth is consumed transporting unnecessary messages.
- **Inefficient Use of Resources** - All devices on the LAN must process and eventually discard the message.
- **Increased Security Risk** - Without additional OSPF security configurations, OSPF messages can be intercepted with packet sniffing software. Routing updates can be modified and sent back to the router, corrupting the routing table with false metrics that misdirect traffic.
