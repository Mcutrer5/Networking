Network problems can arise from transport layer problems on the router, particularly at the edge of the network where traffic is examined and modified. For instance, both access control lists (ACLs) and Network Address Translation (NAT) operate at the network layer and may involve operations at the transport layer, as shown in the figure.

The most common issues with ACLs are caused by improper configuration, as shown in the figure.

Problems with ACLs may cause otherwise working systems to fail. The table lists areas where misconfigurations commonly occur.

|**Misconfigurations**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Selection of traffic flow**|- Traffic is defined by both the router interface through which the traffic is traveling and the direction in which this traffic is traveling.<br>- An ACL must be applied to the correct interface, and the correct traffic direction must be selected to function properly.|
|**Order of access control entries**|- The entries in an ACL should be from specific to general.<br>- Although an ACL may have an entry to specifically permit a type of traffic flow, packets never match that entry if they are being denied by another entry earlier in the list.<br>- If the router is running both ACLs and NAT, the order in which each of these technologies is applied to a traffic flow is important.<br>- Inbound traffic is processed by the inbound ACL before being processed by outside-to-inside NAT.<br>- Outbound traffic is processed by the outbound ACL after being processed by inside-to-outside NAT.|
|**Implicit deny any**|When high security is not required on the ACL, this implicit access control element can be the cause of an ACL misconfiguration.|
|**Addresses and IPv4 wildcard masks**|- Complex IPv4 wildcard masks provide significant improvements in efficiency but are more subject to configuration errors.<br>- An example of a complex wildcard mask is using the IPv4 address 10.0.32.0 and wildcard mask 0.0.32.15 to select the first 15 host addresses in either the 10.0.0.0 network or the 10.0.32.0 network.|
|**Selection of transport layer protocol**|- When configuring ACLs, it is important that only the correct transport layer protocols be specified.<br>- Many network administrators, when unsure whether a type of traffic flow uses a TCP port or a UDP port, configure both.<br>- Specifying both opens a hole through the firewall, possibly giving intruders an avenue into the network.<br>- It also introduces an extra element into the ACL, so the ACL takes longer to process, introducing more latency into network communications.|
|**Source and destination ports**|- Properly controlling the traffic between two hosts requires symmetric access control elements for inbound and outbound ACLs.<br>- Address and port information for traffic generated by a replying host is the mirror image of address and port information for traffic generated by the initiating host.|
|**Use of the established keyword**|- The **established** keyword increases the security provided by an ACL.<br>- However, if the keyword is applied incorrectly, unexpected results may occur.|
|**Uncommon protocols**|- Misconfigured ACLs often cause problems for protocols other than TCP and UDP.<br>- Uncommon protocols that are gaining popularity are VPN and encryption protocols.|

The **log** keyword is a useful command for viewing ACL operation on ACL entries. This keyword instructs the router to place an entry in the system log whenever that entry condition is matched. The logged event includes details of the packet that matched the ACL element. The **log** keyword is especially useful for troubleshooting and provides information on intrusion attempts being blocked by the ACL.
