Troubleshooting can be time consuming because networks differ, problems differ, and troubleshooting experience varies. However, experienced administrators know that using a structured troubleshooting method will shorten overall troubleshooting time.

Therefore, the troubleshooting process should be guided by structured methods. This requires well defined and documented troubleshooting procedures to minimize wasted time associated with erratic hit-and-miss troubleshooting. However, these methods are not static. The troubleshooting steps taken to solve a problem are not always the same or executed in the exact same order.

There are several troubleshooting processes that can be used to solve a problem. The figure displays the logic flowchart of a simplified three-stage troubleshooting process. However, a more detailed process may be more helpful to solve a network problem.
