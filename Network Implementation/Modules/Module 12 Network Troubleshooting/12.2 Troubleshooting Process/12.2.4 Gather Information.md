To gather symptoms from suspected networking device, use Cisco IOS commands and other tools such as packet captures and device logs.

The table describes common Cisco IOS commands used to gather the symptoms of a network problem.

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**ping** {_host_ \| _ip-address_}|- Sends an echo request packet to an address, then waits for a reply<br>- The _host_ or _ip-address_ variable is the IP alias or IP address of the target system|
|**traceroute** _destination_|- Identifies the path a packet takes through the networks<br>- The _destination_ variable is the hostname or IP address of the target system|
|**telnet** {_host_ \| _ip-address_}|- Connects to an IP address using the Telnet application<br>- Use SSH whenever possible instead of Telnet|
|**ssh -l** _user-id_ _ip-address_|- Connects to an IP address using SSH<br>- SSH is more secure than Telnet|
|**show ip interface brief** <br>**show ipv6 interface brief**|- Displays a summary status of all interfaces on a device<br>- Useful for quickly identifying IP addressing on all interfaces.|
|**show ip route**<br>**show ipv6 route**|Displays the current IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables, which contains the routes to all known network destinations|
|**show protocols**|Displays the configured protocols and shows the global and interface-specific status of any configured Layer 3 protocol|
|**debug**|Displays a list of options for enabling or disabling debugging events|

**Note**: Although the **debug** command is an important tool for gathering symptoms, it generates a large amount of console message traffic and the performance of a network device can be noticeably affected. If the **debug** must be performed during normal working hours, warn network users that a troubleshooting effort is underway, and that network performance may be affected. Remember to disable debugging when you are done.
