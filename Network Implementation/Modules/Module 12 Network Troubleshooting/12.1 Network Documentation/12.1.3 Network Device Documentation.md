Network device documentation should contain accurate, up-to-date records of the network hardware and software. Documentation should include all pertinent information about the network devices.

Many organizations create documents with tables or spreadsheets to capture relevant device information.

End-system documentation focuses on the hardware and software used in servers, network management consoles, and user workstations.

For this reason, having access to end-system device documentation can be very useful when troubleshooting.
