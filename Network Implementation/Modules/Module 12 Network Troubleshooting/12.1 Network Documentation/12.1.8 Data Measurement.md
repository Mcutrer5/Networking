When documenting the network, it is often necessary to gather information directly from routers and switches. Obvious useful network documentation commands include **ping**, **traceroute**, and **telnet,** as well as **show** commands.

The table lists some of the most common Cisco IOS commands used for data collection.


|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**show version**|Displays uptime, version information for device software and hardware.|
|**show ip interface** [**brief**] <br>**show ipv6 interface** [**brief**]|- Displays all the configuration options that are set on an interface.<br>- Use the **brief** keyword to only display up/down status of IP interfaces and the IP address of each interface.|
|**show interfaces**|- Displays detailed output for each interface.<br>- To display detailed output for only a single interface, include the interface type and number in the command (e.g. Gigabit Ethernet 0/0/0).|
|**show ip route**<br>**show ipv6 route**|- Displays the routing table content listing directly connected networks and learned remote networks.<br>- Append **static**, **eigrp**, or **ospf** to display those routes only.|
|**show cdp neighbors detail**|Displays detailed information about directly connected Cisco neighbor devices.|
|**show arp**<br>**show ipv6 neighbors**|Displays the contents of the ARP table (IPv4) and the neighbor table (IPv6).|
|**show running-config**|Displays current configuration.|
|**show vlan**|Displays the status of VLANs on a switch.|
|**show port**|Displays the status of ports on a switch.|
|**show tech-support**|- This command is useful for collecting a large amount of information about the device for troubleshooting purposes.<br>- It executes multiple show commands which can be provided to technical support representatives when reporting a problem|

Manual data collection using **show** commands on individual network devices is extremely time consuming and is not a scalable solution. Manual collection of data should be reserved for smaller networks or limited to mission-critical network devices. For simpler network designs, baseline tasks typically use a combination of manual data collection and simple network protocol inspectors.

Sophisticated network management software is typically used to baseline large and complex networks. These software packages enable administrators to automatically create and review reports, compare current performance levels with historical observations, automatically identify performance problems, and create alerts for applications that do not provide expected levels of service.

Establishing an initial baseline or conducting a performance-monitoring analysis may require many hours or days to accurately reflect network performance. Network management software or protocol inspectors and sniffers often run continuously over the course of the data collection process.
