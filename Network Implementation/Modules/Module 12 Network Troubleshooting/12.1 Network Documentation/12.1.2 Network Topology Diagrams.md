Network topology diagrams keep track of the location, function, and status of devices on the network. There are two types of network topology diagrams: the physical topology and the logical topology.

Click each button for an example and explanation of physical and logical topologies.

tab: Physical Topology
**Physical Topology**
<br/><br/>
A physical network topology shows the physical layout of the devices connected to the network. You need to know how devices are physically connected to troubleshoot physical layer problems. Information recorded on the physical topology typically includes the following:
<br/><br/>
- Device name
- Device location (address, room number, rack location)
- Interface and ports used
- Cable type
<br/><br/>
The figure shows a sample physical network topology diagram.

tab: Logical IPv4 Topology
**Logical IPv4 Topology**
<br/><br/>
A logical network topology illustrates how devices are logically connected to the network. This refers to how devices transfer data across the network when communicating with other devices. Symbols are used to represent network components, such as routers, switches, servers, and hosts. Additionally, connections between multiple sites may be shown, but do not represent actual physical locations.
<br/><br/>
Information recorded on a logical network topology may include the following:
<br/><br/>
- Device identifiers
- IP addresses and prefix lengths
- Interface identifiers
- Routing protocols / static routes
- Layer 2 information (i.e., VLANs, trunks, EtherChannels)
<br/><br/>
The figure displays a sample logical IPv4 network topology.

tab: Logical IPv6 Topology
**Logical IPv6 Topology**
<br/><br/>
Although IPv6 addresses could also be displayed in the same IPv4 logical topology, for the sake of clarity, we have created a separate logical IPv6 network topology.
<br/><br/>
The figure displays a sample IPv6 logical topology.
