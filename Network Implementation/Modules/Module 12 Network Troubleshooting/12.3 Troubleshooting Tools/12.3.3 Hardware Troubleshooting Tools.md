There are multiple types of hardware troubleshooting tools.

tab: Digital Multimeters
**Digital Multimeters**
<br/><br/>
Digital multimeters (DMMs), such as the Fluke 179 shown in the figure, are test instruments that are used to directly measure electrical values of voltage, current, and resistance.
<br/><br/>
In network troubleshooting, most tests that would need a multimeter involve checking power supply voltage levels and verifying that network devices are receiving power.

tab: Cable Testers
**Cable Testers**
<br/><br/>
Cable testers are specialized, handheld devices designed for testing the various types of data communication cabling. The figure displays the Fluke LinkRunner AT Network Auto-Tester.
<br/><br/>
Cable testers can be used to detect broken wires, crossed-over wiring, shorted connections, and improperly paired connections. These devices can be inexpensive continuity testers, moderately priced data cabling testers, or expensive time-domain reflectometers (TDRs). TDRs are used to pinpoint the distance to a break in a cable. These devices send signals along the cable and wait for them to be reflected. The time between sending the signal and receiving it back is converted into a distance measurement. The TDR function is normally packaged with data cabling testers. TDRs used to test fiber-optic cables are known as optical time-domain reflectometers (OTDRs).

tab: Cable Analyzers
**Cable Analyzers**
<br/><br/>
Cable analyzers, such as the Fluke DTX Cable Analyzer in the figure, are multifunctional handheld devices that are used to test and certify copper and fiber cables for different services and standards.
<br/><br/>
The more sophisticated tools include advanced troubleshooting diagnostics that measure the distance to a performance defect such as near-end crosstalk (NEXT) or return loss (RL), identify corrective actions, and graphically display crosstalk and impedance behavior. Cable analyzers also typically include PC-based software. After field data is collected, the data from the handheld device can be uploaded so that the network administrator can create up-to-date reports.

tab: Portable Network Analyzers
**Portable Network Analyzers**
<br/><br/>
Portable devices like the Fluke OptiView, shown in the figure, are used for troubleshooting switched networks and VLANs.
<br/><br/>
By plugging the network analyzer in anywhere on the network, a network engineer can see the switch port to which the device is connected, and the average and peak utilization. The analyzer can also be used to discover VLAN configuration, identify top network talkers (hosts generating the most traffic), analyze network traffic, and view interface details. The device can typically output to a PC that has network monitoring software installed for further analysis and troubleshooting.

tab: Cisco Prime<br/>Network Analysis Module
**Cisco Prime Network Analysis Module**
<br/><br/>
The Cisco Prime Network Analysis Module (NAM) portfolio, shown in the figure, includes hardware and software for performance analysis in switching and routing environments. It includes an embedded browser-based interface that generates reports on the traffic that consumes critical network resources. In addition, the NAM can capture and decode packets and track response times to pinpoint an application problem to a network or server.
