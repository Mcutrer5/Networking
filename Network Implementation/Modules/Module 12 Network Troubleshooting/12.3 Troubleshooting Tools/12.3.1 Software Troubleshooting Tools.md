As you know, networks are made up of software and hardware. Therefore, both software and hardware have their respective tools for troubleshooting. This topic discusses the troubleshooting tools available for both.

A wide variety of software and hardware tools are available to make troubleshooting easier. These tools may be used to gather and analyze symptoms of network problems. They often provide monitoring and reporting functions that can be used to establish the network baseline.

**Network Management System Tools**
<br/><br/>
Network management system (NMS) tools include device-level monitoring, configuration, and fault-management tools. These tools can be used to investigate and correct network problems. Network monitoring software graphically displays a physical view of network devices, allowing network managers to monitor remote devices continuously and automatically. Device management software provides dynamic device status, statistics, and configuration information for key network devices. Search the internet for “NMS Tools” for more information

**Knowledge Bases**
<br/><br/>
Online network device vendor knowledge bases have become indispensable sources of information. When vendor-based knowledge bases are combined with internet search engines, a network administrator has access to a vast pool of experience-based information.

For example, the **Cisco Tools & Resources** page can be found at [ht​tp://www.cisco.com](http://www.cisco.com/) under the **Support** menu. This page provides tools that can be used for Cisco hardware and software.

tab: Baselining Tools
**Baselining Tools**

Many tools for automating the network documentation and baselining process are available. Baselining tools help with common documentation tasks. For example, they can draw network diagrams, help keep network software and hardware documentation up-to-date, and help to cost-effectively measure baseline network bandwidth use. Search the internet for “Network Performance Monitoring Tools” for more information.
