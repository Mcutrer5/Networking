Protocol analyzers can investigate packet content while flowing through the network. A protocol analyzer decodes the various protocol layers in a recorded frame and presents this information in a relatively easy to use format. The figure shows a screen capture of the Wireshark protocol analyzer.

The information displayed by a protocol analyzer includes the physical layer bit data, data link layer information, protocols, and descriptions for each frame. Most protocol analyzers can filter traffic that meets certain criteria so that all traffic to and from a device can be captured. Protocol analyzers such as Wireshark can help troubleshoot network performance problems. It is important to have both a good understanding of TCP/IP and how to use a protocol analyzer to inspect information at each TCP/IP layer.
