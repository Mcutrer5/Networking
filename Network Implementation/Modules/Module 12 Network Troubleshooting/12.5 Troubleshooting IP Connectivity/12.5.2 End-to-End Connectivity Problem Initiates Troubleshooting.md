Usually what initiates a troubleshooting effort is the discovery that there is a problem with end-to-end connectivity. Two of the most common utilities used to verify a problem with end-to-end connectivity are **ping** and **traceroute**, as shown in the figure.

tab: IPv4 ping
**IPv4 ping**
<br/><br/>
Ping is probably the most widely-known connectivity-testing utility in networking and has always been part of Cisco IOS Software. It sends out requests for responses from a specified host address. The **ping** command uses a Layer 3 protocol that is a part of the TCP/IP suite called ICMP. Ping uses the ICMP echo request and ICMP echo reply packets. If the host at the specified address receives the ICMP echo request, it responds with an ICMP echo reply packet. Ping can be used to verify end-to-end connectivity for both IPv4 and IPv6. The command output shows a successful ping from PC1 to SRV1, at address 172.16.1.100.

```
C:\> ping 172.16.1.100
Pinging 172.16.1.100 with 32 bytes of data:

tab: IPv4 traceroute
**IPv4 traceroute**
<br/><br/>
Like the **ping** command, the Cisco IOS **traceroute** command can be used for both IPv4 and IPv6. The **tracert** command is used with Windows operating systems. The trace generates a list of hops, router IP addresses and the destination IP address that are successfully reached along the path. This list provides important verification and troubleshooting information. If the data reaches the destination, the trace lists the interface on every router in the path. If the data fails at some hop along the way, the address of the last router that responded to the trace is known. This address is an indication of where the problem or security restrictions reside.
<br/><br/>
The **tracert** output illustrates the path the IPv4 packets take to reach their destination
<br/><br/>

```
C:\> tracert 172.16.1.100
Tracing route to 172.16.1.100 over a maximum of 30 hops:
  1     1 ms    <1 ms    <1 ms  10.1.10.1
  2     2 ms     2 ms     1 ms  192.168.1.2
  3     2 ms     2 ms     1 ms  192.168.1.6
  4     2 ms     2 ms     1 ms  172.16.1.100
Trace complete.

```

tab: IPv6 ping and traceroute
**IPv6 ping and traceroute**
<br/><br/>
When using these utilities, the Cisco IOS utility recognizes whether the address is an IPv4 or IPv6 address and uses the appropriate protocol to test connectivity. The command output shows the **ping** and **traceroute** commands on router R1 used to test IPv6 connectivity.
<br/><br/>

```
R1# ping 2001:db8:acad:4::100 
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 2001:DB8:ACAD:4::100, timeout is 2 seconds:

**Note:** The **traceroute** command is commonly performed when the **ping** command fails. If the **ping** succeeds, the **traceroute** command is commonly not needed because the technician knows that connectivity exists.
