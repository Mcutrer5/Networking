On routers, there may be ACLs that prohibit protocols from passing through the interface in the inbound or outbound direction.

Use the **show ip access-lists** command to display the contents of all IPv4 ACLs and the **show ipv6 access-list** command to display the contents of all IPv6 ACLs configured on a router. The specific ACL can be displayed by entering the ACL name or number as an option for this command. The **show ip interfaces** and **show ipv6 interfaces** commands display IPv4 and IPv6 interface information that indicates whether any IP ACLs are set on the interface.

**Troubleshooting Example**

To prevent spoofing attacks, the network administrator decided to implement an ACL that is preventing devices with a source network address of 172.16.1.0/24 from entering the inbound S0/0/1 interface on R3, as shown in the figure. All other IP traffic should be allowed.

However, shortly after implementing the ACL, users on the 10.1.10.0/24 network were unable to connect to devices on the 172.16.1.0/24 network, including SRV1.

tab: show ip access-lists
**show ip access-lists**
<br/><br/>
The **show ip access-lists** command displays that the ACL is configured correctly, as shown in the command output.
<br/><br/>
```
R3# show ip access-lists
Extended IP access list 100
    10 deny ip 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.255 any (108 matches)
    20 permit ip any any (28 matches)
R3#
```
tab: show ip interfaces
**show ip interfaces**
<br/><br/>
We can verify which interface has the ACL applied using the **show ip interfaces serial 0/1/1** command and the **show ip interfaces serial 0/0/0** command. The output reveals that the ACL was never applied to the inbound interface on Serial 0/0/1 but it was accidentally applied to the G0/0/0 interface, blocking all outbound traffic from the 172.16.1.0/24 network.
<br/><br/>
```
R3# show ip interface serial 0/1/1 | include access list
  Outgoing Common access list is not set
  Outgoing access list is not set
  Inbound Common access list is not set
  Inbound  access list is not set
R3#
R3# show ip interface gig 0/0/0 | include access list
  Outgoing Common access list is not set
  Outgoing access list is not set
  Inbound Common access list is not set
  Inbound  access list is 100

**Correct the Issue**
<br/><br/>
After correctly placing the IPv4 ACL on the Serial 0/0/1 inbound interface, as shown in the command output, devices can successfully connect to the server.
<br/><br/>
```
R3(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0/0/0
R3(config-if)# no ip access-group 100 in
R3(config-if)# exit
R3(config)#
R3(config)# interface serial 0/1/1
R3(config-if)# ip access-group 100 in
R3(config-if)# end
R3#
```
