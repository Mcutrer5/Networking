If there is no detailed route on the router, or if the host is configured with the wrong default gateway, then communication between two endpoints in different networks does not work.

The figure illustrates how PC1 uses R1 as its default gateway. Similarly, R1 uses R2 as its default gateway or gateway of last resort. If a host needs access to resources beyond the local network, the default gateway must be configured. The default gateway is the first router on the path to destinations beyond the local network.

**Troubleshooting IPv4 Default Gateway Example**

In this example, R1 has the correct default gateway, which is the IPv4 address of R2. However, PC1 has the wrong default gateway. PC1 should have the default gateway of R1 10.1.10.1. This must be configured manually if the IPv4 addressing information was manually configured on PC1. If the IPv4 addressing information was obtained automatically from a DHCPv4 server, then the configuration on the DHCP server must be examined. A configuration problem on a DHCP server usually affects multiple clients.
