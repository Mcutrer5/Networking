The DNS protocol controls the DNS, a distributed database with which you can map hostnames to IP addresses. When you configure DNS on the device, you can substitute the hostname for the IP address with all IP commands, such as **ping** or **telnet**.

To display the DNS configuration information on the switch or router, use the **show running-config** command. When there is no DNS server installed, it is possible to enter names to IP mappings directly into the switch or router configuration. Use the **ip host** command to enter a name to be used instead of the IPv4 address of the switch or router, as shown in the command output.

```
R1(config)# ip host ipv4-server 172.16.1.100
R1(config)# exit
R1#
```

Now the assigned name can be used instead of using the IP address, as shown in the command output.

```
R1# ping ipv4-server
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 172.16.1.100, timeout is 2 seconds:

```

To display the name-to-IP-address mapping information on a Windows-based PC, use the **nslookup** command.
