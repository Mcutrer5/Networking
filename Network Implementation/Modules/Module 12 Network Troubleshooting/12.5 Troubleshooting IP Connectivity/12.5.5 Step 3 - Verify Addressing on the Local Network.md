When troubleshooting end-to-end connectivity, it is useful to verify mappings between destination IP addresses and Layer 2 Ethernet addresses on individual segments. In IPv4, this functionality is provided by ARP. In IPv6, the ARP functionality is replaced by the neighbor discovery process and ICMPv6. The neighbor table caches IPv6 addresses and their resolved Ethernet physical (MAC) addresses.

Click each button for an example and explanation of the command to verify Layer 2 and Layer 3 addressing.

tab: Windows IPv4 ARP Table
**Windows IPv4 ARP Table**
<br/><br/>
The **arp** Windows command displays and modifies entries in the ARP cache that are used to store IPv4 addresses and their resolved Ethernet physical (MAC) addresses. As shown in the command output, the **arp** Windows command lists all devices that are currently in the ARP cache.
<br/><br/>
The information that is displayed for each device includes the IPv4 address, physical (MAC) address, and the type of addressing (static or dynamic).
<br/><br/>
The cache can be cleared by using the **arp -d** Windows command if the network administrator wants to repopulate the cache with updated information.
<br/><br/>
**Note**: The **arp** commands in Linux and MAC OS X have a similar syntax.
<br/><br/>

```
C:\> arp -a

tab: Windows IPv6 Neighbor Table
**Windows IPv6 Neighbor Table**
<br/><br/>
The **netsh interface ipv6 show neighbor** Windows command output lists all devices that are currently in the neighbor table.
<br/><br/>
The information that is displayed for each device includes the IPv6 address, physical (MAC) address, and the type of addressing. By examining the neighbor table, the network administrator can verify that destination IPv6 addresses map to correct Ethernet addresses. The IPv6 link-local addresses on all interfaces of R1 have been manually configured to FE80::1. Similarly, R2 has been configured with the link-local address of FE80::2 on its interfaces and R3 has been configured with the link-local address of FE80::3 on its interfaces. Remember, link-local addresses must be unique on the link or network.
<br/><br/>
**Note**: The neighbor table for Linux and MAC OS X can be displayed using **ip neigh show** command.
<br/><br/>
```
C:\> netsh interface ipv6 show neighbor

tab: IOS IPv6 Neighbor Table 
**IOS IPv6 Neighbor Table**
<br/><br/>
The **show ipv6 neighbors** command output displays an example of the neighbor table on the Cisco IOS router.
<br/><br/>
**Note**: The neighbor states for IPv6 are more complex than the ARP table states in IPv4. Additional information is contained in RFC 4861.
<br/><br/>
```
R1# show ipv6 neighbors 
IPv6 Address                        Age  Link-layer Addr   State  Interface
FE80::21E:7AFF:FE79:7A81              8  001e.7a79.7a81    STALE  Gi0/0
2001:DB8:ACAD:1:5075:D0FF:FE8E:9AD8   0  5475.d08e.9ad8    REACH  Gi0/0
```

tab: Switch MAC Address Table
**Switch MAC Address Table**
<br/><br/>
When a destination MAC address is found in the switch MAC address table, the switch forwards the frame only to the port of the device that has that MAC address. To do this, the switch consults its MAC address table. The MAC address table lists the MAC address connected to each port. Use the **show mac address-table** command to display the MAC address table on the switch. An example of a switch MAC address table is shown in the command output.
<br/><br/>
Notice how the MAC address for PC1, a device in VLAN 10, has been discovered along with the S1 switch port to which PC1 attaches. Remember, the MAC address table of switch only contains Layer 2 information, including the Ethernet MAC address and the port number. IP address information is not included.
<br/><br/>

```
S1# show mac address-table
              Mac Address Table
