When troubleshooting, it is often necessary to verify the path to the destination network. The figure shows the reference topology indicating the intended path for packets from PC1 to SRV1.

The routers in the path make the routing decision based on information in the routing tables. Click each button to view the IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables for R1.

The IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables can be populated by the following methods:

- Directly connected networks
- Local host or local routes
- Static routes
- Dynamic routes
- Default routes

The process of forwarding IPv4 and IPv6 packets is based on the longest bit match or longest prefix match. The routing table process will attempt to forward the packet using an entry in the routing table with the greatest number of leftmost matching bits. The number of matching bits is indicated by the prefix length of the route.

The figure describes the process for both the IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables.

![[12.5.9_2.png]]

Examine the following scenarios based on the flow chart above. If the destination address in a packet:

- Does not match an entry in the routing table, then the default route is used. If there is not a default route that is configured, the packet is discarded.
- Matches a single entry in the routing table, then the packet is forwarded through the interface that is defined in this route.
- Matches more than one entry in the routing table and the routing entries have the same prefix length, then the packets for this destination can be distributed among the routes that are defined in the routing table.
- Matches more than one entry in the routing table and the routing entries have different prefix lengths, then the packets for this destination are forwarded out of the interface that is associated with the route that has the longer prefix match.

**Troubleshooting Example**

Devices are unable to connect to the server SRV1 at 172.16.1.100. Using the **show ip route** command, the administrator should check to see if a routing entry exists to network 172.16.1.0/24. If the routing table does not have a specific route to the SRV1 network, the network administrator must then check for the existence of a default or summary route entry in the direction of the 172.16.1.0/24 network. If none exists, then the problem may be with routing and the administrator must verify that the network is included within the dynamic routing protocol configuration or add a static route.
