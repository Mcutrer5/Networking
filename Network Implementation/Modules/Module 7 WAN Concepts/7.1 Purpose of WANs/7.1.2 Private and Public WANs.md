WANs may be built by a variety of different types of organizations, as follows:

- An organization that wants to connect users in different locations
- An ISP that wants to connect customers to the internet
- An ISP or telecommunications that wants to interconnect ISPs

A private WAN is a connection that is dedicated to a single customer. This provides for the following:

- Guaranteed service level
- Consistent bandwidth
- Security

A public WAN connection is typically provided by an ISP or telecommunications service provider using the internet. In this case, the service levels and bandwidth may vary, and the shared connections do not guarantee security.
