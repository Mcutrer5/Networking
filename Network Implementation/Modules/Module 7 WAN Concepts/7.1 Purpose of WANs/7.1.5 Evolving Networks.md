Network requirements of a company can change dramatically as the company grows over time. Distributing employees saves costs in many ways, but it puts increased demands on the network. Not only must a network meet the day-to-day operational needs of the business, but it must be able to adapt and grow as the company changes. Network designers and administrators meet these challenges by carefully choosing network technologies, protocols, and service providers. They must also optimize their networks by using a variety of network design techniques and architectures.

To illustrate differences between network size, we will use a fictitious company called SPAN Engineering as it grows from a small, local, business into a global enterprise. SPAN Engineering, an environmental consulting firm, has developed a special process for converting household waste into electricity and is developing a small pilot project for a municipal government in its local area.

</br>

The company initially consisted of 15 employees working in a small office, as shown in the figure.
</br>

They used a single LAN that was connected to a wireless router for sharing data and peripherals. The connection to the internet is through a common broadband service called Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), which is supplied by their local telephone service provider. To support their IT requirements, they contracted services from the DSL provider.

</br>

Within a few years, the company grew and required several floors of a building, as shown in the figure.
</br>

The company now required a Campus Area Network (CAN). A CAN interconnects several LANs within a limited geographical area. Multiple LANs are required to segment the various departments that are connecting to multiple switches in a campus network environment.
</br>

The network includes dedicated servers for email, data transfer, and file storage, and web-based productivity tools and applications. A firewall secures internet access to corporate users. The business now requires in-house IT staff to support and maintain the network.

</br>

A few years later, the company expanded and added a branch site in the city, and remote and regional sites in other cities, as shown in the figure.
</br>

The company now required a metropolitan area network (MAN) to interconnect sites within the city. A MAN is larger than a LAN, but smaller than a WAN.
</br>

To connect to the central office, branch offices in nearby cities used private dedicated lines through their local service provider. Offices in other cities and countries require the services of a WAN or may use internet services to connect distant locations. However, the internet introduces security and privacy issues that the IT team must address.

**Distributed Network**
</br>

SPAN Engineering has now been in business for 20 years and has grown to thousands of employees distributed in offices worldwide, as shown in the figure.
</br>

To reduce network costs, SPAN encouraged teleworking and virtual teams using web-based applications, including web-conferencing, e-learning, and online collaboration tools to increase productivity and reduce costs. Site-to-site and remote access Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) enable the company to use the internet to connect easily and securely with employees and facilities around the world.
