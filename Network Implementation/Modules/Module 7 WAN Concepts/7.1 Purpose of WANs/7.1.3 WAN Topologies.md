Physical topologies describe the physical network infrastructure used by data when it is travelling from a source to a destination. The physical WAN topology used in WANs is complex and for the most part, unknown to users. Consider a user in New York establishing a video conference call with a user in Tokyo, Japan. Other than the userâ€™s internet connection in New York, it would not be feasible to identify the all of the actual physical connections that are needed to support the video call.

Instead, WAN topologies are described using a logical topology. Logical topologies describe the virtual connection between the source and destination. For example, the video conference call between the user in New York and Japan would be a logical point-to-point connection.

WANs are implemented using the following logical topology designs:

- Point-to-Point Topology
- Hub-and-Spoke Topology
- Dual-homed Topology
- Fully Meshed Topology
- Partially Meshed Topology

**Note**: Large networks usually deploy a combination of these topologies.

tab: Point-to-Point
**Point-to-Point Topology**
</br>

A point-to-point topology, as shown in the figure, employs a point-to-point circuit between two endpoints.

Point-to-point links often involve dedicated, leased-line connections from the corporate edge point to the provider networks. A point-to-point connection involves a Layer 2 transport service through the service provider network. Packets sent from one site are delivered to the other site and vice versa. A point-to-point connection is transparent to the customer network. It seems as if there is a direct physical link between two endpoints.

It can become expensive if many point-to-point connections are required.

tab: Hub-and-Spoke
**Hub-and-Spoke Topology**
</br>

A hub-and-spoke topology enables a single interface on the hub router to be shared by all spoke circuits. Spoke routers can be interconnected through the hub router using virtual circuits and routed subinterfaces. The figure displays a sample hub-and-spoke topology consisting of three spoke routers connecting to a hub router across a WAN cloud.

A hub-and-spoke topology is a single-homed topology. There is only one hub router and all communication must go through it. Therefore, spoke routers can only communicate with each other through the hub router. Consequently, the hub router represents a single point of failure. If it fails, inter-spoke communication also fails.

tab: Dual-horned
**Dual-horned Topology**
</br>

A dual-homed topology provides redundancy. As shown in in the figure, two hub routers are dual-homed and redundantly attached to three spoke routers across a WAN cloud.

The advantage of dual-homed topologies is that they offer enhanced network redundancy, load balancing, distributed computing and processing, and the ability to implement backup service provider connections.

The disadvantage is that they are more expensive to implement than single-homed topologies. This is because they require additional networking hardware, such as additional routers and switches. Dual-homed topologies are also more difficult to implement because they require additional, and more complex, configurations.

tab: Fully Meshed
**Fully Meshed Topology**
</br>

A fully meshed topology uses multiple virtual circuits to connect all sites, as shown in the figure.

This is the most fault-tolerant topology of the five shown. For instance, if site B lost connectivity to site A, it could send the data through either site C or site D.

tab: Partially Meshed
**Partially Meshed Topology**
</br>

A partially meshed topology connects many but not all sites. For example, in the figure sites A, B, C are still fully meshed. Site D must connect to site A to reach sites B and C.
