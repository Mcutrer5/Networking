Whether at work or at home, we all use Local Area Networks (LANs). However, LANs are limited to a small geographical area.

A Wide Area Network (WAN) is required to connect beyond the boundary of the LAN. A WAN is a telecommunications network that spans over a relatively large geographical area. A WAN operates beyond the geographic scope of a LAN.

In the figure, WAN services are required to interconnect an enterprise campus network to remote LANs at branch sites, telecommuter sites, and remote users.

The table highlights differences between LANs and WANs.

| Local Area Networks (LANs)                                                                                                                 | Wide Area Networks (WANs)                                                                                                |

| LANs provide networking services within a small geographic area (i.e., home network, office network, building network, or campus network). | WANs provide networking services over large geographical areas (i.e., in and between cities, countries, and continents). |
| LANs are used to interconnect local computers, peripherals, and other devices.                                                             | WANs are used to interconnect remote users, networks, and sites.                                                         |
| Other than the network infrastructure costs, there is no fee to use a LAN.                                                                 | WANs are owned and managed by internet service, telephone, cable, and satellite providers.                               |
| LANs provide high bandwidth speeds using wired Ethernet and Wi-Fi services.                                                                | WANs providers offer low to high bandwidth speeds, over long distances using complex physical networks.                  |
