Another aspect of WAN design is how an organization connects to the internet. An organization usually signs a service level agreement (SLA) with a service provider. The SLA outlines the expected services relating to the reliability and availability of the connection. The service provider may or may not be the actual carrier. A carrier owns and maintains the physical connection and equipment between the provider and the customer. Typically, an organization will choose either a single-carrier or dual-carrier WAN connection.

A single-carrier connection is when an organization connects to only one service provider, as shown in the figure. An SLA is negotiated between the organization and the service provider. The disadvantage of this design is the carrier connection and service provider are both single points of failure. Connectivity to the internet would be lost if the carrier link or the provider router failed.

A dual-carrier connection provides redundancy and increases network availability, as shown in the figure. The organization negotiates separate SLAs with two different service providers. The organization should ensure that the two providers each use a different carrier. Although more expensive to implement, the second connection can be used for redundancy as a backup link. It could also be used to improve network performance and load balance internet traffic.
