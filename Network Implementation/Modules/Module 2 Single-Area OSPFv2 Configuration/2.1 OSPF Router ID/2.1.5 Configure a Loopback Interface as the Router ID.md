In the reference topology, only the physical interfaces are configured and active. The loopback interfaces have not been configured. When OSPF routing is enabled on the router, the routers would pick the following highest active configured IPv4 address as the router ID.

- R1: 10.1.1.14 (G0/0/1)
- R2: 10.1.1.9 (G0/0/1)
- R3: 10.1.1.13 (G0/0/0)

**Note:** OSPF does not need to be enabled on an interface for that interface to be chosen as the router ID.

Instead of relying on physical interface, the router ID can be assigned to a loopback interface. Typically, the IPv4 address for this type of loopback interface should be configured using a 32-bit subnet mask (255.255.255.255). This effectively creates a host route. A 32-bit host route would not get advertised as a route to other OSPF routers.

The example shows how to configure a loopback interface on R1. Assuming the router ID was not explicitly configured or previously learned, R1 will use IPv4 address 1.1.1.1 as its router ID. Assume R1 has not yet learned a router ID.

```terminal
R1(config-if)# interface Loopback 1
R1(config-if)# ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.255
R1(config-if)# end
R1# show ip protocols | include Router ID
	Router ID 1.1.1.1
R1#
```
