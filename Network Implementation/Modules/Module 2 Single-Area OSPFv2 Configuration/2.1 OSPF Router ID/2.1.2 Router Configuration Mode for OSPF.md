OSPFv2 is enabled using the **router ospf** _process-id_ global configuration mode command, as shown in the command window for R1. The _process-id_ value represents a number between 1 and 65,535 and is selected by the network administrator. The _process-id_ value is locally significant, which means that it does not have to be the same value on the other OSPF routers to establish adjacencies with those neighbors. It is considered best practice to use the same _process-id_ on all OSPF routers.

After entering the **router ospf** _process-id_ command, the router enters router configuration mode, as indicated by the **R1(config-router)#** prompt. Enter a question mark (**?**), to view all the commands available in this mode. The list of commands shown here has been altered to display only the commands that are relevant to this module.
