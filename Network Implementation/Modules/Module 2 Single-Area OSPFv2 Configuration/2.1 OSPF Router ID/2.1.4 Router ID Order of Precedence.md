But how does the router determine the router ID? As illustrated in the figure, Cisco routers derive the router ID based on one of three criteria, in the following preferential order:

1. The router ID is explicitly configured using the OSPF **router-id** _rid_ router configuration mode command. The _rid_ value is any 32-bit value expressed as an IPv4 address. This is the recommended method to assign a router ID.
2. If the router ID is not explicitly configured, the router chooses the highest IPv4 address of any of configured loopback interfaces. This is the next best alternative to assigning a router ID.
3. If no loopback interfaces are configured, then the router chooses the highest active IPv4 address of any of its physical interfaces. This is the least recommended method because it makes it more difficult for administrators to distinguish between specific routers.
