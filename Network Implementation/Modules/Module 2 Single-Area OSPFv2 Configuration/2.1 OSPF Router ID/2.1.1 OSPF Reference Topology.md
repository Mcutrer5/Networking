The figure shows the topology used for configuring OSPFv2 in this module. The routers in the topology have a starting configuration, including interface addresses. There is currently no static routing or dynamic routing configured on any of the routers. All interfaces on R1, R2, and R3 (except the loopback 1 on R2) are within the OSPF backbone area. The ISP router is used as the gateway to the internet of the routing domain.

**Note:** In this topology the loopback interface is used to simulate the WAN link to the Internet and a LAN connected to each router. This is done to allow this topology to be duplicated for demonstration purposes on routers that only have two Gigabit Ethernet interfaces.
