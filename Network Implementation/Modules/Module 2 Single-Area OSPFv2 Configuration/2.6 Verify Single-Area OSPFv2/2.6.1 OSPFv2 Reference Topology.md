Use the **show ip ospf neighbor** command to verify that the router has formed an adjacency with its neighboring routers. If the router ID of the neighboring router is not displayed, or if it does not show as being in a state of FULL, the two routers have not formed an OSPFv2 adjacency.

If two routers do not establish adjacency, link-state information is not exchanged. Incomplete LSDBs can cause inaccurate SPF trees and routing tables. Routes to destination networks may not exist, or may not be the most optimum path.

**Note:** A non-DR or BDR router that has a neighbor relationship with another non-DR or BDR router will display a two-way adjacency instead of full.

The following command output displays the neighbor table of R1.

```
R1# show ip ospf neighbor 
Neighbor ID     Pri   State           Dead Time   Address         Interface
3.3.3.3           0   FULL/  -        00:00:19    10.1.1.13       
GigabitEthernet0/0/1
2.2.2.2           0   FULL/  -        
		00:00:18    10.1.1.6        GigabitEthernet0/0/0
R1#
```

For each neighbor, this command displays the following:

- **Neighbor ID** - This is the router ID of the neighboring router.
- **Pri** - This is the OSPFv2 priority of the interface. This value is used in the DR and BDR election.
- **State** - This is the OSPFv2 state of the interface. FULL state means that the router and its neighbor have identical OSPFv2 LSDBs. On multiaccess networks, such as Ethernet, two routers that are adjacent may have their states displayed as 2WAY. The dash indicates that no DR or BDR is required because of the network type.
- **Dead Time** - This is the amount of time remaining that the router waits to receive an OSPFv2 Hello packet from the neighbor before declaring the neighbor down. This value is reset when the interface receives a Hello packet.
- **Address** - This is the IPv4 address of the interface of the neighbor to which this router is directly connected.
- **Interface** - This is the interface on which this router has formed adjacency with the neighbor.

Two routers may not form an OSPFv2 adjacency if the following occurs:

- The subnet masks do not match, causing the routers to be on separate networks.
- The OSPFv2 Hello or Dead Timers do not match.
- The OSPFv2 Network Types do not match.
- There is a missing or incorrect OSPFv2 network command.
