The **show ip ospf interface** command provides a detailed list for every OSPFv2-enabled interface. Specify an interface to display the settings of just that interface, as shown in the following output for Gigabit Ethernet 0/0/0. This command shows the process ID, the local router ID, the type of network, OSPF cost, DR and BDR information on multiaccess links (not shown), and adjacent neighbors.

```
R1# **show ip ospf interface GigabitEthernet 0/0/0**

To get a quick summary of OSPFv2-enabled interfaces, use the **show ip ospf interface brief** command, as shown in the following command output. This command is useful for seeing important information including the following:

- Interfaces are participating in OSPF
- Networks that are being advertised (IP Address/Mask)
- Cost of each link
- Network state
- Number of neighbors on each link

```
R1# **show ip ospf interface brief**
Interface    PID   Area            IP Address/Mask    Cost  State Nbrs F/C
Lo0          10    0               10.10.1.1/24       10    P2P   0/0
