Within routing configuration mode, there are two ways to identify the interfaces that will participate in the OSPFv2 routing process. The figure shows the reference topology.

In the first example, the wildcard mask identifies the interface based on the network addresses. Any active interface that is configured with an IPv4 address belonging to that network will participate in the OSPFv2 routing process.

```terminal
R1(config)# router ospf 10
R1(config-router)# network 10.10.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
R1(config-router)# network 10.1.1.4 0.0.0.3 area 0
R1(config-router)# network 10.1.1.12 0.0.0.3 area 0
R1(config-router)#
```

**Note:** Some IOS versions allow the subnet mask to be entered instead of the wildcard mask. The IOS then converts the subnet mask to the wildcard mask format.

As an alternative, the second example shows how OSPFv2 can be enabled by specifying the exact interface IPv4 address using a quad zero wildcard mask. Entering **network 10.1.1.5 0.0.0.0 area 0** on R1 tells the router to enable interface Gigabit Ethernet 0/0/0 for the routing process. As a result, the OSPFv2 process will advertise the network that is on this interface (10.1.1.4/30).

```terminal
R1(config)# router ospf 10
R1(config-router)# network 10.10.1.1 0.0.0.0 area 0
R1(config-router)# network 10.1.1.5 0.0.0.0 area 0
R1(config-router)# network 10.1.1.14 0.0.0.0 area 0
R1(config-router)#
```

The advantage of specifying the interface is that the wildcard mask calculation is not necessary. Notice that in all cases, the **area** argument specifies area 0.
