We use loopbacks to provide additional interfaces for a variety of purposes. In this case, we are using loopbacks to simulate more networks than the equipment can support. By default, loopback interfaces are advertised as /32 host routes. For example, R1 would advertise the 10.10.1.0/24 network as 10.10.1.1/32 to R2 and R3.

```
R2# show ip route | include 10.10.1
O        10.10.1.1/32 [110/2] via 10.1.1.5, 00:03:05, GigabitEthernet0/0/0
```

To simulate a real LAN, the Loopback 0 interface is configured as a point-to-point network so that R1 will advertise the full 10.10.1.0/24 network to R2 and R3.

```
R1(config-if)# interface Loopback 0
R1(config-if)# ip ospf network point-to-point
```

Now R2 receives the more accurate, simulated LAN network address of 10.10.1.0/24.

```
R2# show ip route | include 10.10.1
O        10.10.1.0/24 [110/2] via 10.1.1.5, 00:00:30, GigabitEthernet0/0/0
```
