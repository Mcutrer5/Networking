One type of network classified by OSPF is a point-to-point network. You can specify the interfaces that belong to a point-to-point network by configuring the **network** command. You can also configure OSPF directly on the interface with the **ip ospf** command, as we will see later.

Both commands are used to determine which interfaces participate in the routing process for an OSPFv2 area. The basic syntax for the **network** command is as follows:

```terminal
Router(config-router)# network network-address wildcard-mask area area-id
```

- The _network-address wildcard-mask_ syntax is used to enable OSPF on interfaces. Any interfaces on a router that match the network address in the **network** command are enabled to send and receive OSPF packets.
- The **area** _area-id_ syntax refers to the OSPF area. When configuring single-area OSPFv2, the **network** command must be configured with the same _area-id_ value on all routers. Although any area ID can be used, it is good practice to use an area ID of 0 with single-area OSPFv2. This convention makes it easier if the network is later altered to support multiarea OSPFv2.
