The cost of an OSPF route is the accumulated value from one router to the destination network. Assuming the **auto-cost reference-bandwidth 10000** command has been configured on all three routers, the cost of the links between each router is now 10. The loopback interfaces have a default cost of 1, as shown in the figure.

Therefore, we can calculate the cost for each router to reach each network. For example, the total cost for R1 to reach the 10.10.2.0/24 network is 11. This is because the link to R2 cost = 10 and the loopback default cost = 1. 10 + 1 = 11.

The routing table of R1 in Figure 2 confirms that the metric to reach the R2 LAN is a cost of 11.
