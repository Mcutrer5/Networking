As shown in the figure, OSPFv2 Hello packets are transmitted to multicast address 224.0.0.5 (all OSPF routers) every 10 seconds. This is the default timer value on multiaccess and point-to-point networks.

**Note:** Hello packets are not sent on the simulated the LAN interfaces because those interfaces were set to passive by using the router configuration **passive-interface** command.

The Dead interval is the period that the router waits to receive a Hello packet before declaring the neighbor down. If the Dead interval expires before the routers receive a Hello packet, OSPF removes that neighbor from its link-state database (LSDB). The router floods the LSDB with information about the down neighbor out all OSPF-enabled interfaces. Cisco uses a default of 4 times the Hello interval. This is 40 seconds on multiaccess and point-to-point networks.

**Note:** On non-broadcast multiaccess (NBMA) networks, the default Hello interval is 30 seconds and the default dead interval is 120 seconds. NBMA networks are beyond the scope of this module.
