After the DR is elected, it remains the DR until one of the following events occurs:

- The DR fails.
- The OSPF process on the DR fails or is stopped.
- The multiaccess interface on the DR fails or is shutdown.

If the DR fails, the BDR is automatically promoted to DR. This is the case even if another DROTHER with a higher priority or router ID is added to the network after the initial DR/BDR election. However, after a BDR is promoted to DR, a new BDR election occurs and the DROTHER with the highest priority or router ID is elected as the new BDR.

tab: R3 Fails
In this scenario, the current DR (R3) fails. Therefore, the pre-elected BDR (R2) assumes the role of DR. Subsequently, an election is held to choose a new BDR. Because R1 is the only DROTHER, it is elected as the BDR.

tab: R3 Re-Joins Network
In this scenario, R3 has re-joined the network after several minutes of being unavailable. Because the DR and BDR already exist, R3 does not take over either role. Instead, it becomes a DROTHER.

tab: R4 Joins Network
In this scenario, a new router (R4) with a higher router ID is added to the network. DR (R2) and BDR (R1) retain the DR and BDR roles. R4 automatically becomes a DROTHER.

tab: R2 Fails
In this scenario, R2 has failed. The BDR (R1) automatically becomes the DR and an election process selects R4 as the BDR because it has the higher router ID.
