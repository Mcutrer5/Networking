Recall that, in multiaccess networks, OSPF elects a DR and BDR as a solution to manage the number of adjacencies and the flooding of link-state advertisements (LSAs). The DR is responsible for collecting and distributing LSAs sent and received. The DR uses the multicast IPv4 address 224.0.0.5 which is meant for all OSPF routers.

A BDR is also elected in case the DR fails. The BDR listens passively and maintains a relationship with all the routers. If the DR stops producing Hello packets, the BDR promotes itself and assumes the role of DR.

All other routers become a DROTHER (a router that is neither the DR nor the BDR). DROTHERs use the multiaccess address 224.0.0.6 (all designated routers) to send OSPF packets to the DR and BDR. Only the DR and BDR listen for 224.0.0.6.

In the figure, R1, R5, and R4 are DROTHERs. Click play to see the animation of R2 acting as DR. Notice that only the DR and the BDR process the LSA sent by R1 using the multicast IPv4 address 224.0.0.6. The DR then sends out the LSA to all OSPF routers using the multicast IPv4 address 224.0.0.5.
