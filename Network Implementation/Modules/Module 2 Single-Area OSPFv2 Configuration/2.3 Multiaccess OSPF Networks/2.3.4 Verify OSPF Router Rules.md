tab: R1 DROTHER
**R1 DROTHER**

The output generated by R1 confirms that the following:

1. R1 is not the DR or BDR, but is a DROTHER with a default priority of 1. (Line 7)
2. The DR is R3 with router ID 3.3.3.3 at IPv4 address 192.168.1.3, while the BDR is R2 with router ID 2.2.2.2 at IPv4 address 192.168.1.2. (Lines 8 and 9)
3. R1 has two adjacencies: one with the BDR and one with the DR. (Lines 20-22)
