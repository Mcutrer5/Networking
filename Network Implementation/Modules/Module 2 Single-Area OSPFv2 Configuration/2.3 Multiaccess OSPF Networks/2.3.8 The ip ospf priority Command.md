If the interface priorities are equal on all routers, the router with the highest router ID is elected the DR. It is possible to configure the router ID to manipulate the DR/BDR election. However, this process only works if there is a stringent plan for setting the router ID on all routers. Configuring the router ID can help control this. However, in large networks this can be cumbersome.

Instead of relying on the router ID, it is better to control the election by setting interface priorities. This also allows a router to be the DR in one network and a DROTHER in another. To set the priority of an interface, use the command **ip ospf priority** _value_, where value is 0 to 255. A value of 0 does not become a DR or a BDR. A value of 1 to 255 on the interface makes it more likely that the router becomes the DR or the BDR.
