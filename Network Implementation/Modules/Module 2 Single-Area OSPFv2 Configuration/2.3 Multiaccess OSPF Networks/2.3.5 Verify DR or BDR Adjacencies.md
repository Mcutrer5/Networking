To verify the OSPFv2 adjacencies, use the **show ip ospf neighbor** command, as shown in the example for R1. The state of neighbors in multiaccess networks can be as follows:

- **FULL/DROTHER** - This is a DR or BDR router that is fully adjacent with a non-DR or BDR router. These two neighbors can exchange Hello packets, updates, queries, replies, and acknowledgments.
- **FULL/DR** - The router is fully adjacent with the indicated DR neighbor. These two neighbors can exchange Hello packets, updates, queries, replies, and acknowledgments.
- **FULL/BDR** - The router is fully adjacent with the indicated BDR neighbor. These two neighbors can exchange Hello packets, updates, queries, replies, and acknowledgments.
- **2-WAY/DROTHER** - The non-DR or BDR router has a neighbor relationship with another non-DR or BDR router. These two neighbors exchange Hello packets.

The normal state for an OSPF router is usually FULL. If a router is stuck in another state, it is an indication that there are problems in forming adjacencies. The only exception to this is the 2-WAY state, which is normal in a multiaccess broadcast network. For examples, DROTHERs will form a 2-WAY neighbor adjacency with any DROTHERs that join the network. When this happens, the neighbor state displays as 2-WAY/DROTHER.

tab: R1 Adjacencies
The output generated by R1 confirms that R1 has adjacencies with the following routers:

- R2 with router ID 2.2.2.2 is in a Full state and the role of R2 is BDR.
- R3 with router ID 3.3.3.3 is in a Full state and the role of R3 is DR.

tab: R2 Adjacencies
The output generated by R2 confirms that R2 has adjacencies with the following routers:

- R1 with router ID 1.1.1.1 is in a Full state and R1 is neither the DR nor BDR.
- R3 with router ID 3.3.3.3 is in a Full state and the role of R3 is DR.

R2# show ip ospf neighbor

```


tab: R3 Adjacencies
The output generated by R3 confirms that R3 has adjacencies with the following routers:

- R1 with router ID 1.1.1.1 is in a Full state and R1 is neither the DR nor BDR.
- R2 with router ID 2.2.2.2 is in a Full state and the role of R2 is BDR.
