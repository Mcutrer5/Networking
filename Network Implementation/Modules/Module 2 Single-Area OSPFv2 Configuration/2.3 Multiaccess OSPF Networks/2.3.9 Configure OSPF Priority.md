In the topology, the **ip ospf priority** command will be used to change the DR and BDR as follows:

- R1 should be the DR and will be configured with a priority of 255.
- R2 should be the BDR and will be left with the default priority of 1.
- R3 should never be a DR or BDR and will be configured with a priority of 0.

Change the R1 G0/0/0 interface priority from 1 to 255.

```
R1(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0/0/0 
R1(config-if)# ip ospf priority 255 
R1(config-if)# end 
R1#
```

Change the R3 G0/0/0 interface priority from 1 to 0.

```
R3(config)# interface GigabitEthernet 0/0/0
R3(config-if)# ip ospf priority 0
R3(config-if)# end
R3#
```

The following example, shows how to clear the OSPF process on R1. The **clear ip ospf process** command also must be entered on R2 and R3 (not shown). Notice the OSPF state information that is generated.

```
R1# clear ip ospf process
Reset ALL OSPF processes? [no]: y
R1#

The output from the **show in ospf interface g0/0/0** command on R1 confirms that R1 is now the DR with a priority of 255 and identifies the new neighbor adjacencies of R1.
