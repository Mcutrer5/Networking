In the multiaccess topology shown in the figure, there are three routers interconnected over a common Ethernet multiaccess network, 192.168.1.0/24. Each router is configured with the indicated IPv4 address on the Gigabit Ethernet 0/0/0 interface.

Because the routers are connected over a common multiaccess network, OSPF has automatically elected a DR and BDR. In this example, R3 has been elected as the DR because its router ID is 3.3.3.3, which is the highest in this network. R2 is the BDR because it has the second highest router ID in the network.
