The OSPF Type 1 packet is the Hello packet. Hello packets are used to do the following:

- Discover OSPF neighbors and establish neighbor adjacencies.
- Advertise parameters on which two routers must agree to become neighbors.
- Elect the Designated Router (DR) and Backup Designated Router (BDR) on multiaccess networks like Ethernet. Point-to-point links do not require DR or BDR.

The figure displays the fields contained in the OSPFv2 Type 1 Hello packet.
