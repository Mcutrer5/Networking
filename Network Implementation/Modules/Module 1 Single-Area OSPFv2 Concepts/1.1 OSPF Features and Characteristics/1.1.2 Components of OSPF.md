All routing protocols share similar components. They all use routing protocol messages to exchange route information. The messages help build data structures, which are then processed using a routing algorithm.

tab: Routing Protocol Messages
The router builds the topology table using results of calculations based on the Dijkstra shortest-path first (SPF) algorithm. The SPF algorithm is based on the cumulative cost to reach a destination.

The SPF algorithm creates an SPF tree by placing each router at the root of the tree and calculating the shortest path to each node. The SPF tree is then used to calculate the best routes. OSPF places the best routes into the forwarding database, which is used to make the routing table. <br/>

tab: Data Structures
OSPF messages are used to create and maintain three OSPF databases, as follows:

- **Adjacency database** - This creates the neighbor table.
- **Link-state database (LSDB)** - This creates the topology table.
- **Forwarding database** - This creates the routing table.

These tables contain a list of neighboring routers to exchange routing information. The tables are kept and maintained in RAM. In the following table, take a particular note of the command used to display each table.

| Database | Table | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Adjacency Database | Neighbor Table | - List of all neighbor routers to which a router has established bidirectional communication. <br/> - This table is unique for each router. <br/> - Can be viewed using the ```show ip ospf neighbor``` command |
| Link-state Database | Topology Table | - Lists information about all other routers in the network. <br/> - This database represents the network topology. <br/> All routers within an area have identical LSDB. <br/> Can be viewed using the ```show ip ospf database``` command. |
| Forwarding Database | Routing Table | - List of routes generated when an algorithm is run on the link-state database. <br/> - The routing table of each router is unique and contains information on how and where to send packets to other routers. <br/> - Can be viewed using the ```show ip route``` command. |
