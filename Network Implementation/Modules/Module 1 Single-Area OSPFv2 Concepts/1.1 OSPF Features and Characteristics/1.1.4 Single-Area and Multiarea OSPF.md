To make OSPF more efficient and scalable, OSPF supports hierarchical routing using areas. An OSPF area is a group of routers that share the same link-state information in their LSDBs. OSPF can be implemented in one of two ways, as follows:

- **Single-Area OSPF** - All routers are in one area. Best practice is to use area 0.
- **Multiarea OSPF** - OSPF is implemented using multiple areas, in a hierarchical fashion. All areas must connect to the backbone area (area 0). Routers interconnecting the areas are referred to as Area Border Routers (ABRs).
