Now that you know about the OSPF link-state packets, this topic explains how they work with OSPF-enabled routers. When an OSPF router is initially connected to a network, it attempts to:

- Create adjacencies with neighbors
- Exchange routing information
- Calculate the best routes
- Reach convergence

The table details the states OSPF progresses through while attempting to reach convergence:

| State          | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Down State     | - No Hello packets received = Down <br/> - Router sends Hello packets <br/> - Transition to Init state                                                                   |
| Init State     | - Hello packets are received from the neighbor <br/> - They contain the Router ID of the sending router <br/> - Transition to Two-Way state                              |
| Two-Way State  | - In this state, communication between the two routers is bidirectional <br/> - On multiaccess links, the routers elect a DR and a BDR <br/> Transition to ExStart state |
| ExStart State  | On point-to-point networks, the two routers decide which router will initiate the DBD packet exhange and decide upon the initial DBD packet sequence number              |
| Exchange State | - Routers exchange DBD packets <br/> - If additional router information is required then transition to Loading; otherwise, transition to the Full state                  |
| Loading State  | - LSRs and LSUs are used to gain additional route information <br/> - Routes are processed using the SPF algorithm <br/> - Transition to the Full state                  |
| Full State     | The link-state database of the router is fully synchronized                                                                                                              |
