Why is a DR and BDR election necessary?

Multiaccess networks can create two challenges for OSPF regarding the flooding of LSAs, as follows:

- **Creation of multiple adjacencies** - Ethernet networks could potentially interconnect many OSPF routers over a common link. Creating adjacencies with every router is unnecessary and undesirable. It would lead to an excessive number of LSAs exchanged between routers on the same network.
- **Extensive flooding of LSAs** - Link-state routers flood their LSAs any time OSPF is initialized, or when there is a change in the topology. This flooding can become excessive.

To understand the problem with multiple adjacencies, we must study a formula:

For any number of routers (designated as _n_) on a multiaccess network, there are _n (n - 1) / 2_ adjacencies.

For example, the figure shows a simple topology of five routers, all of which are attached to the same multiaccess Ethernet network. Without some type of mechanism to reduce the number of adjacencies, collectively these routers would form 10 adjacencies:

**5 (5 - 1) / 2 = 10**

This may not seem like much, but as routers are added to the network, the number of adjacencies increases dramatically. For example, a multiaccess network with 20 routers would create 190 adjacencies.

### Creating Adjacencies With Every Neighbor

- *Number of Adjacencies = n (n - 1) / 2*
- *n = number of routers*
- *Example: 5 (5 - 1) / 2 = 10 adjacencies*
