After the Two-Way state, routers transition to database synchronization states. While the Hello packet was used to establish neighbor adjacencies, the other four types of OSPF packets are used during the process of exchanging and synchronizing LSDBs. This is a three step process, as follows:

1. Decide first router
2. Exchange DBDs
3. Send an LSR

**1. Decide First Router**

In the ExStart state, the two routers decide which router will send the DBD packets first. The router with the higher router ID will be the first router to send DBD packets during the Exchange state. In the figure, R2 has the higher router ID and sends its DBD packets first. <br/>

tab: Exchange DBDs
**2. Exchange DBDs**

In the Exchange state, the two routers exchange one or more DBD packets. A DBD packet includes information about the LSA entry header that appears in the LSDB of the router. The entries can be about a link or about a network. Each LSA entry header includes information about the link-state type, the address of the advertising router, the cost of the link, and the sequence number. The router uses the sequence number to determine the newness of the received link-state information.

In the figure, R2 sends a DBD packet to R1. When R1 receives the DBD, it performs the following actions:

1. It acknowledges the receipt of the DBD using the LSAck packet.
2. R1 then sends DBD packets to R2.
3. R2 acknowledges R1. <br/>

tab: Send and LSR
**3. Send an LSR**

R1 compares the information received with the information it has in its own LSDB. If the DBD packet has a more current link-state entry, the router transitions to the Loading state.

For example, in the figure, R1 sends an LSR regarding network 172.16.6.0 to R2. R2 responds with the complete information about 172.16.6.0 in an LSU packet. Again, when R1 receives an LSU, it sends an LSAck. R1 then adds the new link-state entries into its LSDB.

After all LSRs have been satisfied for a given router, the adjacent routers are considered synchronized and in a full state. Updates (LSUs) are sent only to neighbors in the following conditions:

- When a change is perceived (incremental updates)
- Every 30 minutes <br/>
