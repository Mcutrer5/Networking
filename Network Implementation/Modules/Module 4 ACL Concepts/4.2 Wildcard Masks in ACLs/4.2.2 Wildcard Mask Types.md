Using wildcard masks will take some practice. Refer to the examples to learn how the wildcard mask is used to filter traffic for one host, one subnet, and a range IPv4 addresses.

tab: Wildcard to Match a Host
**Wildcard to Match a Host**

In this example, the wildcard mask is used to match a specific host IPv4 address. Assume ACL 10 needs an ACE that only permits the host with IPv4 address 192.168.1.1. Recall that “0” equals a match and “1” equals ignore. To match a specific host IPv4 address, a wildcard mask consisting of all zeroes (i.e., 0.0.0.0) is required.

The table lists in binary, the host IPv4 address, the wildcard mask, and the permitted IPv4 address.

The 0.0.0.0 wildcard mask stipulates that every bit must match exactly. Therefore, when the ACE is processed, the wildcard mask will permit only the 192.168.1.1 address. The resulting ACE in ACL 10 would be **access-list 10 permit 192.168.1.1 0.0.0.0.**

|     | Decimal | Binary |
|-----|---------|--------|
| IPv4 address | `192.168.1.1` | `11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001` |
| Wildcard Mask | `0.0.0.0` | `00000000.00000000.00000000.00000000` |
| Permitted IPv4 Address | `192.168.1.1` | `11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001` |

tab: Wildcard Mask to Match an IPv4 Subnet
**Wildcard Mask to Match an IPv4 Subnet**

In this example, ACL 10 needs an ACE that permits all hosts in the 192.168.1.0/24 network. The wildcard mask 0.0.0.255 stipulates that the very first three octets must match exactly but the fourth octet does not.

The table lists in binary, the host IPv4 address, the wildcard mask, and the permitted IPv4 addresses.

When processed, the wildcard mask 0.0.0.255 permits all hosts in the 192.168.1.0/24 network. The resulting ACE in ACL 10 would be **access-list 10 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255.**

tab: Wildcard Mask to Match an IPv4 Address Range
**Wildcard Mask to Match an IPv4 Address Range**

In this example, ACL 10 needs an ACE that permits all hosts in the 192.168.16.0/24, 192.168.17.0/24, …, 192.168.31.0/24 networks. The wildcard mask 0.0.15.255 would correctly filter that range of addresses.

The table lists in binary the host IPv4 address, the wildcard mask, and the permitted IPv4 addresses.

The highlighted wildcard mask bits identify which bits of the IPv4 address must match. When processed, the wildcard mask 0.0.15.255 permits all hosts in the 192.168.16.0/24 to 192.168.31.0/24 networks. The resulting ACE in ACL 10 would be **access-list 10 permit 192.168.16.0 0.0.15.255.**
