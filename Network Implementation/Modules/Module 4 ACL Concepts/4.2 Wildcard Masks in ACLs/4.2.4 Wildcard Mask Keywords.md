Working with decimal representations of binary wildcard mask bits can be tedious. To simplify this task, the Cisco IOS provides two keywords to identify the most common uses of wildcard masking. Keywords reduce ACL keystrokes and make it easier to read the ACE.

The two keywords are:

- **host** - This keyword substitutes for the 0.0.0.0 mask. This mask states that all IPv4 address bits must match to filter just one host address.
- **any** - This keyword substitutes for the 255.255.255.255 mask. This mask says to ignore the entire IPv4 address or to accept any addresses.

For example, in the command output, two ACLs are configured. The ACL 10 ACE permits only the 192.168.10.10 host and the ACL 11 ACE permits all hosts.

```
R1(config)# access-list 10 permit 192.168.10.10  0.0.0.0
R1(config)# access-list 11 permit  0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255
R1(config)#
```

Alternatively, the keywords **host** and **any** could have been used to replace the highlighted output.

The following commands accomplishes the same task as the previous commands.

```
R1(config)# access-list 10 permit  host  192.168.10.10
R1(config)# access-list 11 permit  any
R1(config)#
```
