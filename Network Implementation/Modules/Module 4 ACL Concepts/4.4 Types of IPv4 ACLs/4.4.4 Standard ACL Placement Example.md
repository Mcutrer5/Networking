Following the guidelines for ACL placement, standard ACLs should be located as close to the destination as possible.

In the figure, the administrator wants to prevent traffic originating in the 192.168.10.0/24 network from reaching the 192.168.30.0/24 network.

Following the basic placement guidelines, the administrator would place a standard ACL on router R3. There are two possible interfaces on R3 to apply the standard ACL:

- **R3 S0/1/1 interface** **(inbound)** - The standard ACL can be applied inbound on the R3 S0/1/1 interface to deny traffic from.10 network. However, it would also filter.10 traffic to the 192.168.31.0/24 (.31 in this example) network. Therefore, the standard ACL should not be applied to this interface.
- **R3 G0/0 interface** **(outbound)** - The standard ACL can be applied outbound on the R3 G0/0/0 interface. This will not affect other networks that are reachable by R3. Packets from.10 network will still be able to reach the.31 network. This is the best interface to place the standard ACL to meet the traffic requirements.
