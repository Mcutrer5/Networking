The previous topics covered the purpose of ACL and the guidelines for ACL creation. This topic will cover standard and extended ACLs, named and numbered ACLs, and the examples of placement of these ACLs.

There are two types of IPv4 ACLs:

- **Standard ACLs** - These permit or deny packets based only on the source IPv4 address.
- **Extended ACLs** - These permit or deny packets based on the source IPv4 address and destination IPv4 address, protocol type, source and destination TCP or UDP ports and more.

For example, refer to the following standard ALC command.

```
R1(config)# access-list 10 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255
R1(config)#
```

ACL 10 permits hosts on the source network 192.168.10.0/24. Because of the implied "deny any" at the end, all traffic except for traffic coming from the 192.168.10.0/24 network is blocked with this ACL.

In the next example, an extended ACL 100 permits traffic originating from any host on the 192.168.10.0/24 network to any IPv4 network if the destination host port is 80 (HTTP).

```
R1(config)# access-list 100 permit tcp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any eq www
R1(config)#
```

Notice how the standard ACL 10 is only capable of filtering by source address while the extended ACL 100 is filtering on the source, and destination Layer 3, and Layer 4 protocol (i.e., TCP) information.

**Note:** Full ACL configuration is discussed in another module.
