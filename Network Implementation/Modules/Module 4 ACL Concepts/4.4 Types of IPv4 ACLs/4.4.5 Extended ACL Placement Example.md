Extended ACL should be located as close to the source as possible. This prevents unwanted traffic from being sent across multiple networks only to be denied when it reaches its destination.

However, the organization can only place ACLs on devices that they control. Therefore, the extended ACL placement must be determined in the context of where organizational control extends.

In the figure, for example, Company A wants to deny Telnet and FTP traffic to Company Bâ€™s 192.168.30.0/24 network from their 192.168.11.0/24 network while permitting all other traffic.

There are several ways to accomplish these goals. An extended ACL on R3 would accomplish the task, but the administrator does not control R3. In addition, this solution allows unwanted traffic to cross the entire network, only to be blocked at the destination. This affects overall network efficiency.

The solution is to place an extended ACL on R1 that specifies both source and destination addresses.

There are two possible interfaces on R1 to apply the extended ACL:

- **R1 S0/1/0 interface (outbound)** - The extended ACL can be applied outbound on the S0/1/0 interface. However, this solution will process all packets leaving R1 including packets from 192.168.10.0/24.
- **R1 G0/0/1 interface (inbound)** - The extended ACL can be applied inbound on the G0/0/1 and only packets from the 192.168.11.0/24 network are subject to ACL processing on R1. Because the filter is to be limited to only those packets leaving the 192.168.11.0/24 network, applying the extended ACL to G0/1 is the best solution.
