Using ACLs requires attention to detail and great care. Mistakes can be costly in terms of downtime, troubleshooting efforts, and poor network service. Basic planning is required before configuring an ACL.

The table presents guidelines that form the basis of an ACL best practices list.

| Guideline                                                                                | Benefit                                                                    |

| Base ACLs on the organizational security policies.                                       | This will ensure you implement organizational security guidelines.         |
| Write out what you want the ACL to do.                                                   | This will help you avoid inadvertently creating potential access problems. |
| Use a text editor to create, edit, and save all of your ACLs.                            | This will help you create a library of reusable ACLs.                      |
| Document the ACLs using the `remark` command.                                            | This will help you (and others) understand the purpose of an ACE.          |
| Test the ACLs on a development network before implementing them on a production network. | This will help you avoid costly errors.                                    |
