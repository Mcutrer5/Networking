ACLs define the set of rules that give added control for packets that enter inbound interfaces, packets that relay through the router, and packets that exit outbound interfaces of the router.

ACLs can be configured to apply to inbound traffic and outbound traffic, as shown in the figure.

**Note:** ACLs do not act on packets that originate from the router itself.

An inbound ACL filters packets before they are routed to the outbound interface. An inbound ACL is efficient because it saves the overhead of routing lookups if the packet is discarded. If the packet is permitted by the ACL, it is then processed for routing. Inbound ACLs are best used to filter packets when the network attached to an inbound interface is the only source of packets that need to be examined.

An outbound ACL filters packets after being routed, regardless of the inbound interface. Incoming packets are routed to the outbound interface and then they are processed through the outbound ACL. Outbound ACLs are best used when the same filter will be applied to packets coming from multiple inbound interfaces before exiting the same outbound interface.

When an ACL is applied to an interface, it follows a specific operating procedure. For example, here are the operational steps used when traffic has entered a router interface with an inbound standard IPv4 ACL configured.

1. The router extracts the source IPv4 address from the packet header.
2. The router starts at the top of the ACL and compares the source IPv4 address to each ACE in a sequential order.
3. When a match is made, the router carries out the instruction, either permitting or denying the packet, and the remaining ACEs in the ACL, if any, are not analyzed.
4. If the source IPv4 address does not match any ACEs in the ACL, the packet is discarded because there is an implicit deny ACE automatically applied to all ACLs.

The last ACE statement of an ACL is always an implicit deny that blocks all traffic. By default, this statement is automatically implied at the end of an ACL even though it is hidden and not displayed in the configuration.

**Note:** An ACL must have at least one permit statement otherwise all traffic will be denied due to the implicit deny ACE statement.
