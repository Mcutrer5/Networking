Routers make routing decisions based on information in the packet header. Traffic entering a router interface is routed solely based on information within the routing table. The router compares the destination IP address with routes in the routing table to find the best match and then forwards the packet based on the best match route. That same process can be used to filter traffic using an access control list (ACL).

An ACL is a series of IOS commands that are used to filter packets based on information found in the packet header. By default, a router does not have any ACLs configured. However, when an ACL is applied to an interface, the router performs the additional task of evaluating all network packets as they pass through the interface to determine if the packet can be forwarded.

An ACL uses a sequential list of permit or deny statements, known as access control entries (ACEs).

**Note:** ACEs are also commonly called ACL statements.

When network traffic passes through an interface configured with an ACL, the router compares the information within the packet against each ACE, in sequential order, to determine if the packet matches one of the ACEs. This process is called packet filtering.

Several tasks performed by routers require the use of ACLs to identify traffic. The table lists some of these tasks with examples.

| **Task**                                                  | **Example**                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Limit network traffic to increase network performance     | • A corporate policy prohibits video traffic on the network to reduce the network load.<br>• A policy can be enforced using ACLs to block video traffic.                                                                          |
| Provide traffic flow control                              | • A corporate policy requires that routing protocol traffic be limited to certain links only.<br>• A policy can be implemented using ACLs to restrict the deliver of routing updates to only those that come from a known source. |
| Provide a basic level of security for network access      | • Corporate policy demands that access to Human Resources network be restricted to authorized users only.<br>• A policy can be enforced using ACLs to limit access to specified networks.                                         |
| Filter traffic based on traffic type                      | • Corporate policy requires that email traffic be permitted into a network, but that Telnet access be denied.<br>• A policy can be implemented using ACLs to filter traffic by type.                                              |
| Screen hosts to permit or deny access to network services | • Corporate policy requires that access to some file types (e.g. FTP or HTTP) be limited to user groups.<br>• A policy can be implemented using ACLs to filter user access to services.                                           |
| Provide priority to certain classes of network traffic    | • Corporate traffic specifies that voice traffic be forwarded as fast as possible to avoid any interruption.<br>• A policy can be implemented using ACLs and QoS services to identify voice traffic and process it immediately.   |
