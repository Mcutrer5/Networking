#### a. Overview

- **Troubleshooting** involves systematically identifying and resolving issues in a computer system.
- Begin by gathering information about the problem to understand its nature.

#### b. Steps

1. **Define the Problem:**
    
    - Clearly articulate the issue or symptom.
    - Gather information from users or system logs.
2. **Reproduce the Problem:**
    
    - Attempt to recreate the issue to understand its triggers.
    - Determine if the problem is consistent or intermittent.

### 2. Establish a Theory of Probable Cause

#### a. Overview

- **Theory of Probable Cause** is a hypothesis about the likely source of the problem.
- Based on information gathered during the identification phase.

#### b. Steps

1. **List Possible Causes:**
    
    - Identify potential sources of the problem.
    - Consider recent changes, software updates, or hardware modifications.
2. **Prioritize Causes:**
    
    - Evaluate and prioritize potential causes.
    - Focus on the most likely factors based on available information.
3. **Test the Theory:**
    
    - Conduct tests or experiments to validate or refute the theory.
    - Gather additional data to refine the hypothesis.
