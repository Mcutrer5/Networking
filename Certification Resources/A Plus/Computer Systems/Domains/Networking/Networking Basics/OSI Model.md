#### a. Overview

- The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers.
- Each layer serves a specific purpose and communicates with the adjacent layers.

#### b. Seven Layers

1. **Physical Layer:**
    
    - Deals with the physical connection between devices.
    - Specifies characteristics such as voltage levels, data rates, and physical connectors.
2. **Data Link Layer:**
    
    - Responsible for creating a reliable link between two directly connected nodes.
    - Divided into Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC) sublayers.
3. **Network Layer:**
    
    - Manages logical addressing and routing of data between devices on different networks.
    - IP (Internet Protocol) operates at this layer.
4. **Transport Layer:**
    
    - Ensures end-to-end communication and data flow control.
    - Common protocols include TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
5. **Session Layer:**
    
    - Manages sessions or connections between applications.
    - Responsible for dialog control and synchronization.
6. **Presentation Layer:**
    
    - Translates data between the application layer and the lower layers.
    - Handles data compression, encryption, and formatting.
7. **Application Layer:**
    
    - Provides a network interface for user applications.
    - Supports network services like email, file transfers, and remote access.

#### c. Key Concepts

- Understanding the OSI model helps troubleshoot network issues by pinpointing the layer at which a problem occurs.
- The model aids in designing and implementing network solutions.
