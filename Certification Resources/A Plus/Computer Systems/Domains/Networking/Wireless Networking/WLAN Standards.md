#### a. Overview

- **WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network)** standards define the specifications for wireless communication between devices.
- Common standards include IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6).

#### b. Key Standards

| Wi-Fi Standard | Frequency Band | Key Features |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| 802.11a        | 5 GHz           | Higher data rates, shorter range compared to 802.11b and g. |
| 802.11b        | 2.4 GHz         | Slower data rates, better range compared to 802.11a. |
| 802.11g        | 2.4 GHz         | Combines speed of 802.11a with range of 802.11b. |
| 802.11n        | 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz | Introduces MIMO technology for improved performance. |
| 802.11ac       | 5 GHz           | Higher data rates, improved performance over 802.11n. |
| 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) | 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz | Latest standard, designed for high-efficiency wireless communication. - Increased capacity and faster data rates. |


#### c. Considerations

- WLAN standards determine compatibility and performance.
- Choosing the right standard depends on factors such as data rate requirements, range, and interference.
