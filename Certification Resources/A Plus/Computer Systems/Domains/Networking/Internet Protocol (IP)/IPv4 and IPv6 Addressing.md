#### a. IPv4 Addressing

##### i. Overview

- **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)** is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol and is widely used for network communication.
- It uses a 32-bit address scheme, allowing for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.

##### ii. IPv4 Address Structure

- An IPv4 address is represented in dotted-decimal format (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
- It consists of four octets, each ranging from 0 to 255.
- Octets represent different levels of the network hierarchy (network, subnet, host).

##### iii. Classes of IPv4 Addresses

1. **Class A:**
    
    - Used for large networks.
    - First octet represents the network, and the remaining three octets represent hosts.
2. **Class B:**
    
    - Suitable for medium-sized networks.
    - First two octets represent the network, and the remaining two octets represent hosts.
3. **Class C:**
    
    - Commonly used for small networks.
    - First three octets represent the network, and the last octet represents hosts.
4. **Class D and E:**
    
    - Reserved for multicast and experimental purposes, respectively.

#### b. IPv6 Addressing

##### i. Overview

- **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)** is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol, designed to replace IPv4.
- It uses a 128-bit address scheme, providing an exponentially larger address space.

##### ii. IPv6 Address Structure

- IPv6 addresses are represented in hexadecimal notation (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
- Divided into eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons.

##### iii. Advantages of IPv6

1. **Larger Address Space:**
    
    - Supports an enormous number of unique addresses, overcoming IPv4 limitations.
2. **Simplified Header:**
    
    - Streamlined header structure improves packet processing and routing efficiency.
3. **Improved Security and Mobility:**
    
    - Built-in security features and enhanced support for mobile devices.
