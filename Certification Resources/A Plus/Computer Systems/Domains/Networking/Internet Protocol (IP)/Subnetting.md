##### i. Purpose

- **Subnetting** divides a large network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks.
- Enhances network performance, security, and organization.

##### ii. Subnet Mask

- A **subnet mask** is used to divide an IP address into network and host portions.
- It is represented in binary and determines the size of the network and host segments.

##### iii. Subnetting Process

1. **Determine Subnet Requirements:**
    
    - Identify the number of subnets and hosts required.
2. **Select Subnet Mask:**
    
    - Choose an appropriate subnet mask based on requirements.
3. **Assign Subnet Addresses:**
    
    - Allocate subnet addresses to each subnet.
4. **Allocate Host Addresses:**
    
    - Assign individual host addresses within each subnet.
