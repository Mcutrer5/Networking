#### a. Overview

- Storage devices store and retrieve data for the computer.
- Common types include HDDs (Hard Disk Drives), SSDs (Solid State Drives), and hybrid drives.

#### b. Key Types

1. **HDD (Hard Disk Drive):**
    
    - Uses magnetic storage on spinning disks.
    - Slower than SSDs but offers larger capacities at a lower cost.
2. **SSD (Solid State Drive):**
    
    - Employs NAND-based flash memory for faster data access.
    - More durable and energy-efficient compared to HDDs.
3. **Hybrid Drive:**
    
    - Combines features of HDDs and SSDs for a balance of speed and capacity.
    - Automatically moves frequently accessed data to the faster SSD portion.
