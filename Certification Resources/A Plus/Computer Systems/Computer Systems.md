Computer systems include hardware, software, and firmware.
Hardware is something you can touch and feel; the physical
computer and the parts inside the computer are examples of
hardware. The monitor, keyboard, and mouse are hardware
components. Software interacts with the hardware. [[Windows]], [[Linux]],
[[macOS]], Microsoft Office, Solitaire, Google Chrome, Adobe Acrobat
Reader, and WordPerfect are examples of software.

Without software that directs the hardware to accomplish
something, a computer is no more than a doorstop. Every computer
needs an important piece of software called an [[operating system]],
which coordinates the interaction between hardware and software
applications. The operating system also handles the interaction
between a user and the computer. Examples of operating systems
include Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10, macOS, and various Linux
systems, such as Red Hat and Ubuntu.

A [[device driver]] is a special piece of software designed to enable
a hardware component. The device driver enables the operating
system to recognize, control, and use the hardware component.
Device drivers are hardware and operating system specific. For
example, a printer requires a specific device driver when connected
to a computer loaded with Windows 7. The same printer will most
likely require a different device driver when using Windows 8 or 10.
Each piece of installed hardware requires a device driver for the
operating system being used. Figure 1.9 shows how hardware and
software must work together.
