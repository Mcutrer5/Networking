1. **Server Hardware Preparation**

- **Power Off and Disconnect:**

	- Power off the HPE server completely.
	- Disconnect all peripheral devices (monitors, keyboards, mice, network cables).
	- Disconnect the server from the power source.

- **Open the Server:**

	- Carefully open the server case according to the HPE server manual.
	- Locate the hard drives and the RAID controller card (likely an HPE Smart Array controller).  
      
    

2. **RAID Configuration (using HPE Smart Array Controller)**

- **Access RAID Controller:**

	- **During Server Startup:** Press the designated key (usually F10 or Ctrl+H) to enter the HPE Intelligent Provisioning interface.
	- **Navigate to RAID Configuration:** Within Intelligent Provisioning, navigate to the RAID configuration section.

	- **Create RAID Array:**

	- **Clear Existing Configurations (if applicable):** If any existing RAID arrays are present, delete them.
	- **Create New Array:**

	- **Select RAID Level:** For a balance of performance and redundancy, we will use RAID 5.
	- **Assign Drives:**

	- **Drive 1:** Assign the first drive. Set its size to 300GB.
	- **Drive 2:** Assign the second drive. Set its size to 500GB.
	- **Drive 3:** Assign the third drive. Set its size to "Max" or "Full Capacity."

	- **Create and Initialize:** Follow the on-screen prompts to create and initialize the RAID array. This might involve:

	- **Creating a Virtual Drive:** Define the size and other parameters of the virtual drive that will be created from the RAID array.
	- **Initializing the Array:** This process can take some time. Monitor the progress within the Intelligent Provisioning interface.

- **Verify Array Status:**

	- After initialization, carefully review the RAID array status within the Intelligent Provisioning interface. Ensure the array is operating correctly and all drives are functioning properly.  
      
    

3. **Install Operating System**

	- **Prepare Installation Media:** Create bootable installation media (USB drive or DVD) for your chosen operating system (e.g., Windows Server, Linux).
	- **Boot from Installation Media:**

	- Power on the server.
	- Enter the server's BIOS/UEFI settings (usually by pressing F9 during startup) and configure the boot order to prioritize the installation media.

- **Begin Installation:**

	- Follow the on-screen instructions to begin the operating system installation.
- **Crucial Step:** During the installation process, select the newly created RAID array as the target drive for the operating system installation.

- **Install HPE Smart Array Drivers:**

- **During Installation:** If possible, install the latest HPE Smart Array drivers during the operating system installation process.
- **Post-Installation:** If not installed during setup, install the latest drivers after the operating system installation is complete. These drivers are available on the HPE support website.  
      
    

4. **Post-Installation Checks**

- **Verify RAID Array Status:**

	- Check the RAID array status using the HPE Array Configuration Utility (ACU) or within the operating system's disk management tools.
	- Ensure the array is operating correctly and all drives are functioning properly.

- **Run Disk Checks:**

	- Perform disk checks on the RAID array to verify data integrity.

- **Test System Performance:**

	- Run performance benchmarks to ensure the system is performing as expected.  
      
    

5. **Configure and Optimize**

- **Install Necessary Software:**

	- Install all required applications and server roles.

- **Configure Network Settings:**

	- Configure network settings (IP addresses, DNS servers, etc.).

- **Apply Security Updates:**

	- Install the latest security updates and patches for the operating system and all installed software.
