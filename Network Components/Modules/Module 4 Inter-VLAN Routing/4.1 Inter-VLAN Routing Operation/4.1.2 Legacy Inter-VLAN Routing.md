The first inter-VLAN routing solution relied on using a router with multiple Ethernet interfaces. Each router interface was connected to a switch port in different VLANs. The router interfaces served as the default gateways to the local hosts on the VLAN subnet.

For example, refer to the topology where R1 has two interfaces connected to switch S1.

Notice in the example MAC address table of S1 is populated as follows:

- Fa0/1 port is assigned to VLAN 10 and is connected to the R1 G0/0/0 interface.
- Fa0/11 port is assigned to VLAN 10 and is connected to PC1.
- Fa0/12 port is assigned to VLAN 20 and is connected to the R1 G0/0/1 interface.
- Fa0/24 port is assigned to VLAN 20 and is connected to PC2.

# MAC Address table for S1

| Port  | MAC Address   | VLAN |
| ----- | ------------- | ---- |
| F0/1  | R1 G0/0/0 MAC | 10   |
| F0/11 | PC1 MAC       | 10   |
| F0/12 | R1 G0/0/1 MAC | 20   |
| F0/24 | PC2 MAC       | 20   |

When PC1 sends a packet to PC2 on another network, it forwards it to its default gateway 192.168.10.1. R1 receives the packet on its G0/0/0 interface and examines the destination address of the packet. R1 then routes the packet out its G0/0/1 interface to the F0/12 port in VLAN 20 on S1. Finally, S1 forwards the frame to PC2.

Legacy inter-VLAN routing using physical interfaces works, but it has a significant limitation. It is not reasonably scalable because routers have a limited number of physical interfaces. Requiring one physical router interface per VLAN quickly exhausts the physical interface capacity of a router.

In our example, R1 required two separate Ethernet interfaces to route between VLAN 10 and VLAN 20. What if there were six (or more) VLANs to interconnect? A separate interface would be required for each VLAN. Obviously, this solution is not scalable.

**Note:** This method of inter-VLAN routing is no longer implemented in switched networks and is included for explanation purposes only.
