The modern method of performing inter-VLAN routing is to use Layer 3 switches and switched virtual interfaces (SVI). An SVI is a virtual interface that is configured on a Layer 3 switch, as shown in the figure.

**Note:** A Layer 3 switch is also called a multilayer switch as it operates at Layer 2 and Layer 3. However, in this course we use the term Layer 3 switch.

Inter-VLAN SVIs are created the same way that the management VLAN interface is configured. The SVI is created for a VLAN that exists on the switch. Although virtual, the SVI performs the same functions for the VLAN as a router interface would. Specifically, it provides Layer 3 processing for packets that are sent to or from all switch ports associated with that VLAN.

The following are advantages of using Layer 3 switches for inter-VLAN routing:

- They are much faster than router-on-a-stick because everything is hardware switched and routed.
- There is no need for external links from the switch to the router for routing.
- They are not limited to one link because Layer 2 EtherChannels can be used as trunk links between the switches to increase bandwidth.
- Latency is much lower because data does not need to leave the switch in order to be routed to a different network.
- They more commonly deployed in a campus LAN than routers.

The only disadvantage is that Layer 3 switches are more expensive.
