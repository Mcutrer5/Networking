VLANs are used to segment switched Layer 2 networks for a variety of reasons. Regardless of the reason, hosts in one VLAN cannot communicate with hosts in another VLAN unless there is a router or a Layer 3 switch to provide routing services.

Inter-VLAN routing is the process of forwarding network traffic from one VLAN to another VLAN.

There are three inter-VLAN routing options:

- **Legacy Inter-VLAN routing** - This is a legacy solution. It does not scale well.
- **Router-on-a-Stick** - This is an acceptable solution for a small to medium-sized network.
- **Layer 3 switch using switched virtual interfaces (SVIs)** - This is the most scalable solution for medium to large organizations.
