By now, you know that when you configure and verify, you must also be able to troubleshoot. This topic discusses some common network problems associated with inter-VLAN routing.

There are a number of reasons why an inter-VAN configuration may not work. All are related to connectivity issues. First, check the physical layer to resolve any issues where a cable might be connected to the wrong port. If the connections are correct, then use the list in the table for other common reasons why inter-VLAN connectivity may fail.

| Missing VLANs               | • Create (or re-create) the VLAN if it does not exist<br>• Ensure the host port is assigned to the correct VLAN.                               | `show vlan [brief]`<br>`show interfaces switchport`<br>`ping`                 |
| Switch Trunk Port Issues    | • Ensure trunks are configured correctly.<br>• Ensure port is a trunk port and enabled                                                         | `show interfaces trunk`<br>`show running-config`                              |
| Switch Access Port Issues   | • Assign correct VLAN to access port.<br>• Ensure port is an access port and enabled.<br>• Host is incorrectly configured in the wrong subnet. | `show interfaces switchport`<br>`show running-config interface`<br>`ipconfig` |
| Router Configuration Issues | • Router subinterface IPv4 address is incorrectly configured.<br>• Router subinterface is assigned to the VLAN ID.                             | `show ip interface brief`<br>`show interfaces`                                |
