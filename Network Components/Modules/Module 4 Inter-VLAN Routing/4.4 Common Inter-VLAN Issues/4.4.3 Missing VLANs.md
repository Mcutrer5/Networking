An inter-VLAN connectivity issue could be caused by a missing VLAN. The VLAN could be missing if it was not created, it was accidently deleted, or it is not allowed on the trunk link.

For example, PC1 is currently connected to VLAN 10, as shown in the **show vlan brief** command output.

```
S1# show vlan brief
VLAN Name                             Status    Ports
---- -------------------------------- --------- -------------------------------
1    default                          active    Fa0/2, Fa0/3, Fa0/4, Fa0/7                                                
												Fa0/8, Fa0/9, Fa0/10, Fa0/11                                                
												Fa0/12, Fa0/13, Fa0/14, Fa0/15                                                
												Fa0/16, Fa0/17, Fa0/18, Fa0/19                                                
												Fa0/20, Fa0/21, Fa0/22, Fa0/23                                                
												Fa0/24, Gi0/1, Gi0/2
10   LAN10                            active    Fa0/6
20   LAN20                            active
99   Management                       active
1002 fddi-default                     act/unsup
1003 token-ring-default               act/unsup
1004 fddinet-default                  act/unsup
1005 trnet-default                    act/unsup
S1#
```

Now assume that VLAN 10 is accidently deleted, as shown in the following output.

```
S1(config)# no vlan 10
S1(config)# do show vlan brief
VLAN Name                             Status    Ports
---- -------------------------------- --------- -------------------------------
1    default                          active    Fa0/2, Fa0/3, Fa0/4, Fa0/7                                                
												Fa0/8, Fa0/9, Fa0/10, Fa0/11                                                
												Fa0/12, Fa0/13, Fa0/14, Fa0/15                                                
												Fa0/16, Fa0/17, Fa0/18, Fa0/19                                                
												Fa0/20, Fa0/21, Fa0/22, Fa0/23                                                
												Fa0/24, Gi0/1, Gi0/2
20   LAN20                            active
99   Management                       active
1002 fddi-default                     act/unsup
1003 token-ring-default               act/unsup
1004 fddinet-default                  act/unsup
1005 trnet-default                    act/unsup
S1(config)#
```

Notice VLAN 10 is now missing from the output. Also notice that port Fa0/6 has not been reassigned to the default VLAN. The reason is because when you delete a VLAN, any ports assigned to that VLAN become inactive. They remain associated with the VLAN (and thus inactive) until you assign them to a new VLAN or recreate the missing VLAN.

Use the **show interface** _interface-id_ **switchport** command to verify the VLAN membership.

```
S1(config)# do show interface fa0/6 switchport
Name: Fa0/6
Switchport: Enabled
Administrative Mode: static access
Operational Mode: static access
Administrative Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q
Operational Trunking Encapsulation: native
Negotiation of Trunking: Off
Access Mode VLAN: 10 (Inactive)
Trunking Native Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Administrative Native VLAN tagging: enabled
Voice VLAN: none
(Output omitted)
```

Recreating the missing VLAN would automatically reassign the hosts to it, as shown in the following output.

![[4.4.3_1.png]]

Notice that the VLAN has not been created as expected. The reason is because you must exit from VLAN sub-configuration mode to create the VLAN, as shown in the following output

![[4.4.3_2.png]]

Now notice that the VLAN is included in the list and that the host connected to Fa0/6 is on VLAN 10.
