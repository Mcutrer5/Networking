Another issue for inter-VLAN routing includes misconfigured switch ports. In a legacy inter-VLAN solution, this could be caused when the connecting router port is not assigned to the correct VLAN.

However, with a router-on-a-stick solution, the most common cause is a misconfigured trunk port.

For example, assume PC1 was able to connect to hosts in other VLANs until recently. A quick look at maintenance logs revealed that the S1 Layer 2 switch was recently accessed for routine maintenance. Therefore, you suspect the problem may be related to that switch.

On S1, verify that the port connecting to R1 (i.e., F0/5) is correctly configured as a trunk link using the **show interfaces trunk** command, as shown.

The Fa0/5 port connecting to R1 is mysteriously missing from the output. Verify the interface configuration using the **show running-config interface fa0/5** command, as shown.

As you can see, the port was accidently shut down. To correct the problem, re-enable the port and verify the trunking status, as shown in the output.

To reduce the risk of a failed inter-switch link disrupting inter-VLAN routing, redundant links and alternate paths should be part of the network design.
