Modern, enterprise networks rarely use router-on-a-stick because it does not scale easily to meet requirements. In these very large networks, network administrators use Layer 3 switches to configure inter-VLAN routing.

Inter-VLAN routing using the router-on-a-stick method is simple to implement for a small to medium-sized organization. However, a large enterprise requires a faster, much more scalable method to provide inter-VLAN routing.

Enterprise campus LANs use Layer 3 switches to provide inter-VLAN routing. Layer 3 switches use hardware-based switching to achieve higher-packet processing rates than routers. Layer 3 switches are also commonly implemented in enterprise distribution layer wiring closets.

Capabilities of a Layer 3 switch include the ability to do the following:

- Route from one VLAN to another using multiple switched virtual interfaces (SVIs).
- Convert a Layer 2 switchport to a Layer 3 interface (i.e., a routed port). A routed port is similar to a physical interface on a Cisco IOS router.

To provide inter-VLAN routing, Layer 3 switches use SVIs. SVIs are configured using the same **interface vlan** _vlan-id_ command used to create the management SVI on a Layer 2 switch. A Layer 3 SVI must be created for each of the routable VLANs.
