In the figure, the previously configured D1 Layer 3 switch is now connected to R1. R1 and D1 are both in an Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol domain. Assume inter-VLAN has been successfully implemented on D1. The G0/0/1 interface of R1 has also been configured and enabled. Additionally, R1 is using OSPF to advertise its two networks, 10.10.10.0/24 and 10.20.20.0/24.

**Note:** OSPF routing configuration is covered in another course. In this module, OSPF configuration commands will be given to you in all activities and assessments. It is not required that you understand the configuration in order to enable OSPF routing on the Layer 3 switch
