Inter-VLAN routing using a Layer 3 switch is simpler to configure than the router-on-a-stick method. After the configuration is complete, the configuration can be verified by testing connectivity between the hosts.

From a host, verify connectivity to a host in another VLAN using the **ping** command. It is a good idea to first verify the current host IP configuration using the **ipconfig** Windows host command. The output confirms the IPv4 address and default gateway of PC1.

```
C:\Users\PC1> ipconfig
Windows IP Configuration
Ethernet adapter Ethernet0:  
	Connection-specific DNS Suffix . :
	Link-local IPv6 Address          : fe80::5c43:ee7c:2959:da68%6  
	IPv4 Address                     : 192.168.10.10  
	Subnet Mask                      : 255.255.255.0  
	Default Gateway                  : 192.168.10.1
C:\Users\PC1> 
```

Next, verify connectivity with PC2 using the **ping** Windows host command, as shown in the output. The **ping** output successfully confirms inter-VLAN routing is operating.

```
C:\Users\PC1> ping 192.168.20.10
