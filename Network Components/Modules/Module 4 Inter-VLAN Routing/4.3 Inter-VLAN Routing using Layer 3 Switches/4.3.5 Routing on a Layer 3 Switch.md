If VLANs are to be reachable by other Layer 3 devices, then they must be advertised using static or dynamic routing. To enable routing on a Layer 3 switch, a routed port must be configured.

A routed port is created on a Layer 3 switch by disabling the switchport feature on a Layer 2 port that is connected to another Layer 3 device. Specifically, configuring the **no switchport** interface configuration command on a Layer 2 port converts it into a Layer 3 interface. Then the interface can be configured with an IPv4 configuration to connect to a router or another Layer 3 switch.
