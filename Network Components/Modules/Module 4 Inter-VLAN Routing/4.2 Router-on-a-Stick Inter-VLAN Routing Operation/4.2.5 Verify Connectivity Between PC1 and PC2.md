The router-on-a-stick configuration is complete after the switch trunk and the router subinterfaces have been configured. The configuration can be verified from the hosts, router, and switch.

From a host, verify connectivity to a host in another VLAN using the **ping** command. It is a good idea to first verify the current host IP configuration using the **ipconfig** Windows host command.

```
C:\Users\PC1> ipconfig
Windows IP Configuration
Ethernet adapter Ethernet0:
	Connection-specific DNS Suffix . :  
	Link-local IPv6 Address          : fe80::5c43:ee7c:2959:da68%6  
	IPv4 Address                     : 192.168.10.10  
	Subnet Mask                      : 255.255.255.0  
	Default Gateway                  : 192.168.10.1
C:\Users\PC1> 
```

The output confirms the IPv4 address and default gateway of PC1. Next, use **ping** to verify connectivity with PC2 and S1, as shown in the figure. The **ping** output successfully confirms inter-VLAN routing is operating.

```
