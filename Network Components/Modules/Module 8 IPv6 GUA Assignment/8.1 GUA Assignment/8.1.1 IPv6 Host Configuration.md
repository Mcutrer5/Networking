First things first. To use either stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC) or DHCPv6, you should review global unicast addresses (GUAs) and link-local addresses (LLAs). This topic covers both.

On a router, an IPv6 global unicast address (GUA) is manually configured using the **ipv6 address** _ipv6-address_**_/_**_prefix-length_ interface configuration command.

A Windows host can also be manually configured with an IPv6 GUA address configuration, as shown in the figure.

Manually entering an IPv6 GUA can be time consuming and somewhat error prone. Therefore, most Windows host are enabled to dynamically acquire an IPv6 GUA configuration, as shown in the figure.
