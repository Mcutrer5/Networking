Use the **show ipv6 dhcp pool** and **show ipv6 dhcp binding** commands to verify DHCPv6 operation on a router.

````tabs
tab: show ipv6 dhcp pool
The **show ipv6 dhcp pool** command verifies the name of the DHCPv6 pool and its parameters. The command also identifies the number of active clients. In this example, the IPV6-STATEFUL pool currently has 2 clients, which reflects PC1 and R3 receiving their IPv6 global unicast address from this server.

When a router is providing stateful DHCPv6 services, it also maintains a database of assigned IPv6 addresses.

```
R1# show ipv6 dhcp pool
DHCPv6 pool: IPV6-STATEFUL
  Address allocation prefix: 2001:DB8:ACAD:1::/64 valid 172800 preferred 86400 (2 in use,  0 conflicts)
  DNS server: 2001:4860:4860::8888
  Domain name: example.com
  Active clients: 2
R1#
```
tab: show ipv6 dhcp binding
Use the **show ipv6 dhcp binding** command output to display the IPv6 link-local address of the client and the global unicast address assigned by the server.

The output displays the current stateful binding on R1. The first client in the output is PC1 and the second client is R3.

This information is maintained by a stateful DHCPv6 server. A stateless DHCPv6 server would not maintain this information.

```
R1# show ipv6 dhcp binding
