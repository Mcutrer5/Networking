A router can also be a DHCPv6 client and get an IPv6 configuration from a DHCPv6 server, such as a router functioning as a DHCPv6 server. In the figure, R1 is a stateless DHCPv6 server.

![[8.4.3.png]]

There are five steps to configure and verify a router as a stateless DHCPv6 client.

**Step 1**. Enable IPv6 routing.  
  
**Step 2**. Configure the client router to create an LLA.  
  
**Step 3**. Configure the client router to use SLAAC.  
  
**Step 4**. Verify that the client router is assigned a GUA.  
  
**Step 5**. Verify that the client router received other necessary DHCPv6 information.

tab: Step 1
**Step 1. Enable IPv6 routing.**
<br/><br/>
The DHCPv6 client router needs to have **ipv6 unicast-routing** enabled.
<br/><br/>
```
R3(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
R3(config)#
```
tab: Step 2
**Step 2. Configure client router to create an LLA.**
<br/><br/>
The client router needs to have a link-local address. An IPv6 link-local address is created on a router interface when a global unicast address is configured. It can also be created without a GUA using the **ipv6 enable** interface configuration command. Cisco IOS uses EUI-64 to create a randomized Interface ID.
<br/><br/>
In the output, the **ipv6 enable** command is configured on the Gigabit Ethernet 0/0/1 interface of the R3 client router.
<br/><br/>
```
R3(config)# interface g0/0/1
R3(config-if)# ipv6 enable
R3(config-if)# 
```
tab: Step 3
**Step 3. Configure client router to use SLAAC.**
<br/><br/>
The client router needs to be configured to use SLAAC to create an IPv6 configuration. The **ipv6 address autoconfig** command enables the automatic configuration of IPv6 addressing using SLAAC.
<br/><br/>
```
R3(config-if)# ipv6 address autoconfig
R3(config-if)# end
R3#
```
tab: Step 4
**Step 4. Verify client router is assigned a GUA.**
<br/><br/>
Use the **show ipv6 interface brief** command to verify the host configuration as shown. The output confirms that the G0/0/1 interface on R3 was assigned a valid GUA.
<br/><br/>
**Note:** it may take the interface a few seconds to complete the process.
<br/><br/>
```
R3# show ipv6 interface brief
GigabitEthernet0/0/0   [up/up]
    unassigned
GigabitEthernet0/0/1   [up/up]
    FE80::2FC:BAFF:FE94:29B1
    2001:DB8:ACAD:1:2FC:BAFF:FE94:29B1
Serial0/1/0            [up/up]
    unassigned
Serial0/1/1            [up/up]
    unassigned
R3#
```
tab: Step 5
**Step 5. Verify client router received other DHCPv6 information.**
<br/><br/>
The **show ipv6 dhcp interface g0/0/1** command confirms that the DNS and domain names were also learned by R3.
<br/><br/>
```
R3# show ipv6 dhcp interface g0/0/1
GigabitEthernet0/0/1 is in client mode
