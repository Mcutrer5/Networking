If the DHCPv6 server is located on a different network than the client, then the IPv6 router can be configured as a DHCPv6 relay agent. The configuration of a DHCPv6 relay agent is similar to the configuration of an IPv4 router as a DHCPv4 relay.

In the figure, R3 is configured as a stateful DHCPv6 server. PC1 is on the 2001:db8:acad:2::/64 network and requires the services of a stateful DHCPv6 server to acquire its IPv6 configuration. R1 needs to be configured as the DHCPv6 Relay Agent.

The command syntax to configure a router as a DHCPv6 relay agent is as follows:

```
Router(config-if)# ipv6 dhcp relay destination ipv6-address [interface-type interface-number]
```

This command is configured on the interface facing the DHCPv6 clients and specifies the DHCPv6 server address and egress interface to reach the server, as shown in the output. The egress interface is only required when the next-hop address is an LLA.

```
R1(config)# interface gigabitethernet 0/0/1
R1(config-if)# ipv6 dhcp relay destination 2001:db8:acad:1::2 G0/0/0
R1(config-if)# exit
R1(config)#
```
