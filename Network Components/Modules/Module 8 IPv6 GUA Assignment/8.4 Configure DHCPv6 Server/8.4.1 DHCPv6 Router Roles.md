Cisco IOS routers are powerful devices. In smaller networks, you do not have to have separate devices to have a DHCPv6 server, client, or relay agent. A Cisco IOS router can be configured to provide DHCPv6 server services.

Specifically, it can be configured to be one of the following:

- **DHCPv6 Server** – Router provides stateless or stateful DHCPv6 services.
- **DHCPv6 Client** – Router interface acquires an IPv6 IP configuration from a DHCPv6 server.
- **DHCPv6 Relay Agent** – Router provides DHCPv6 forwarding services when the client and the server are located on different networks.
