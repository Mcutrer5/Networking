A router can also be a DHCPv6 client. The client router needs to have **ipv6 unicast-routing** enabled and an IPv6 link-local address to send and receive IPv6 messages.

Refer to the sample topology to learn how to configure the stateful DHCPv6 client.

![[8.4.5.png]]

There are five steps to configure and verify a router as a stateful DHCPv6 client.

**Step 1**. Enable IPv6 routing.  
  
**Step 2**. Configure the client router to create an LLA.  
  
**Step 3**. Configure the client router to use DHCPv6.  
  
**Step 4**. Verify that the client router is assigned a GUA.  
  
**Step 5**. Verify that the client router received other necessary DHCPv6 information.

tab: Step 1
**Step 1. Enable IPv6 routing.**

The DHCPv6 client router needs to have **ipv6 unicast-routing** enabled.

```
R3(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
R3(config)#
```
tab: Step 2
**Step 2. Configure client router to create an LLA.**

In the output, the **ipv6 enable** command is configured on the R3 Gigabit Ethernet 0/0/1 interface. This enables the router to create an IPv6 LLA without needing a GUA.

```
R3(config)# interface g0/0/1
R3(config-if)# ipv6 enable
R3(config-if)# 
```
tab: Step 3
**Step 3. Configure client router to use DHCPv6.**

The **ipv6 address dhcp** command configures R3 to solicit its IPv6 addressing information from a DHCPv6 server.

```
R3(config-if)# ipv6 address dhcp
R3(config-if)# end
R3#
```
tab: Step 4
**Step 4. Verify client router is assigned a GUA.**

Use the **show ipv6 interface brief** command to verify the host configuration as shown.

```
R3# show ipv6 interface brief
GigabitEthernet0/0/0   [up/up]
    unassigned
GigabitEthernet0/0/1   [up/up]
    FE80::2FC:BAFF:FE94:29B1
    2001:DB8:ACAD:1:B4CB:25FA:3C9:747C
Serial0/1/0            [up/up]
    unassigned
Serial0/1/1            [up/up]
    unassigned
R3#
```
tab: Step 5
**Step 5. Verify client router received other DHCPv6 information.**

The **show ipv6 dhcp interface g0/0/1** command confirms that the DNS and domain names were learned by R3.

```
R3# show ipv6 dhcp interface g0/0/1
GigabitEthernet0/0/1 is in client mode
