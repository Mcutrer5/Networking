Using SLAAC, a host typically acquires its 64-bit IPv6 subnet information from the router RA. However, it must generate the remainder 64-bit interface identifier (ID) using one of two methods:

- **Randomly generated** - The 64-bit interface ID is randomly generated by the client operating system. This is the method now used by Windows 10 hosts.
- **EUI-64** - The host creates an interface ID using its 48-bit MAC address. The host inserts the hex value of fffe in the middle of the address, and flips the seventh bit of the interface ID. This changes the value of the second hexadecimal digit of the interface ID. Some operating systems default to the randomly generated interface ID instead of the EUI-64 method, due to privacy concerns. This is because the Ethernet MAC address of the host is used by EUI-64 to create the interface ID.

**Note:** Windows, Linux, and Mac OS allow for the user to modify the generation of the interface ID to be either randomly generated or to use EUI-64.

For instance, in the following **ipconfig** output, the Windows 10 PC1 host used the IPv6 subnet information contained in the R1 RA and randomly generated a 64-bit interface ID as highlighted in the output.
