Not every network has or needs access to a DHCPv6 server. But every device in an IPv6 network needs a GUA. The SLAAC method enables hosts to create their own unique IPv6 global unicast address without the services of a DHCPv6 server.

SLAAC is a stateless service. This means there is no server that maintains network address information to know which IPv6 addresses are being used and which ones are available.

SLAAC uses ICMPv6 RA messages to provide addressing and other configuration information that would normally be provided by a DHCP server. A host configures its IPv6 address based on the information that is sent in the RA. RA messages are sent by an IPv6 router every 200 seconds.

A host can also send a Router Solicitation (RS) message requesting that an IPv6-enabled router send the host an RA.

SLAAC can be deployed as SLAAC only, or SLAAC with DHCPv6.
