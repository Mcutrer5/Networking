The process enables the host to create an IPv6 address. However, there is no guarantee that the address is unique on the network.

SLAAC is a stateless process; therefore, a host has the option to verify that a newly created IPv6 address is unique before it can be used. The Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) process is used by a host to ensure that the IPv6 GUA is unique.

DAD is implemented using ICMPv6. To perform DAD, the host sends an ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message with a specially constructed multicast address, called a solicited-node multicast address. This address duplicates the last 24 bits of IPv6 address of the host.

If no other devices respond with a NA message, then the address is virtually guaranteed to be unique and can be used by the host. If an NA is received by the host, then the address is not unique, and the operating system has to determine a new interface ID to use.

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) recommends that DAD is used on all IPv6 unicast addresses regardless of whether it is created using SLAAC only, obtained using stateful DHCPv6, or manually configured. DAD is not mandatory because a 64-bit interface ID provides 18 quintillion possibilities and the chance that there is a duplication is remote. However, most operating systems perform DAD on all IPv6 unicast addresses, regardless of how the address is configured.
