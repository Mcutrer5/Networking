This option is most similar to DHCPv4. In this case, the RA message tells the client to obtain all addressing information from a stateful DHCPv6 server, except the default gateway address which is the source IPv6 link-local address of the RA.

This is known as stateful DHCPv6 because the DHCPv6 server maintains IPv6 state information. This is similar to a DHCPv4 server allocating addresses for IPv4.

The figure illustrates stateful DHCPv6 operation.

1. PC1 receives a DHCPv6 RA message with the O flag set to 0 and the M flag set to 1, indicating to PC1 that it will receive all its IPv6 addressing information from a stateful DHCPv6 server.
2. PC1 sends a DHCPv6 SOLICIT message looking for a stateful DHCPv6 server.

**Note:** If A=1 and M=1, some operating systems such as Windows will create an IPv6 address using SLAAC and obtain a different address from the stateful DHCPv6 server. In most cases it is recommended to manually set the A flag to 0.
