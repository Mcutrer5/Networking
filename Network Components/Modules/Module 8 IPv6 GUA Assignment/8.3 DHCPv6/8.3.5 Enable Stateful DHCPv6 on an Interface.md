Stateful DHCPv6 is enabled on a router interface using the **ipv6 nd managed-config-flag** interface configuration command. This sets the M flag to 1.

The highlighted output in the example confirms that the RA will tell the host to obtain all IPv6 configuration information from a DHCPv6 server (M flag = 1).

```
R1(config)# int g0/0/1
R1(config-if)# ipv6 nd managed-config-flag
R1(config-if)# end
R1#
R1# show ipv6 interface g0/0/1 | begin ND
