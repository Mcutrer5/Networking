Cisco provides HSRP and HSRP for IPv6 as a way to avoid losing outside network access if your default router fails.

HSRP is a Cisco-proprietary FHRP that is designed to allow for transparent failover of a first-hop IP device.

HSRP ensures high network availability by providing first-hop routing redundancy for IP hosts on networks configured with an IP default gateway address. HSRP is used in a group of routers for selecting an active device and a standby device. In a group of device interfaces, the active device is the device that is used for routing packets; the standby device is the device that takes over when the active device fails, or when pre-set conditions are met. The function of the HSRP standby router is to monitor the operational status of the HSRP group and to quickly assume packet-forwarding responsibility if the active router fails.
