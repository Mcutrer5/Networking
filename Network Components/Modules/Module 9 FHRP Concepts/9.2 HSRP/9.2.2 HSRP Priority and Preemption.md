The role of the active and standby routers is determined during the HSRP election process. By default, the router with the numerically highest IPv4 address is elected as the active router. However, it is always better to control how your network will operate under normal conditions rather than leaving it to chance.

**HSRP Priority**

HSRP priority can be used to determine the active router. The router with the highest HSRP priority will become the active router. By default, the HSRP priority is 100. If the priorities are equal, the router with the numerically highest IPv4 address is elected as the active router.

To configure a router to be the active router, use the **standby priority** interface command. The range of the HSRP priority is 0 to 255.

**HSRP Preemption**

By default, after a router becomes the active router, it will remain the active router even if another router comes online with a higher HSRP priority.

To force a new HSRP election process to take place when a higher priority router comes online, preemption must be enabled using the **standby preempt** interface command. Preemption is the ability of an HSRP router to trigger the re-election process. With preemption enabled, a router that comes online with a higher HSRP priority will assume the role of the active router.

Preemption only allows a router to become the active router if it has a higher priority. A router enabled for preemption, with equal priority but a higher IPv4 address will not preempt an active router. Refer to the topology in the figure.

R1 has been configured with the HSRP priority of 150 while R2 has the default HSRP priority of 100. Preemption has been enabled on R1. With a higher priority, R1 is the active router and R2 is the standby router. Due to a power failure affecting only R1, the active router is no longer available and the standby router, R2, assumes the role of the active router. After power is restored, R1 comes back online. Because R1 has a higher priority and preemption is enabled, it will force a new election process. R1 will re-assume the role of the active router and R2 will fall back to the role of the standby router.

**Note:** With preemption disabled, the router that boots up first will become the active router if there are no other routers online during the election process.
