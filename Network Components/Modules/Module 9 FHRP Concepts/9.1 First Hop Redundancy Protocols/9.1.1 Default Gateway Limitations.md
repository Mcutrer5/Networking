If a router or router interface (that serves as a default gateway) fails, the hosts configured with that default gateway are isolated from outside networks. A mechanism is needed to provide alternate default gateways in switched networks where two or more routers are connected to the same VLANs. That mechanism is provided by first hop redundancy protocols (FHRPs).

In a switched network, each client receives only one default gateway. There is no way to use a secondary gateway, even if a second path exists to carry packets off the local segment.

In the figure, R1 is responsible for routing packets from PC1. If R1 becomes unavailable, the routing protocols can dynamically converge. R2 now routes packets from outside networks that would have gone through R1. However, traffic from the inside network associated with R1, including traffic from workstations, servers, and printers configured with R1 as their default gateway, are still sent to R1 and dropped.

**Note:** For the purposes of the discussion on router redundancy, there is no functional difference between a Layer 3 switch and a router at the distribution layer. In practice, it is common for a Layer 3 switch to act as the default gateway for each VLAN in a switched network. This discussion focuses on the functionality of routing, regardless of the physical device used.

End devices are typically configured with a single IPv4 address for a default gateway. This address does not change when the network topology changes. If that default gateway IPv4 address cannot be reached, the local device is unable to send packets off the local network segment, effectively disconnecting it from other networks. Even if a redundant router exists that could serve as a default gateway for that segment, there is no dynamic method by which these devices can determine the address of a new default gateway.

**Note:** IPv6 devices receive their default gateway address dynamically from the ICMPv6 Router Advertisement. However, IPv6 devices benefit with a faster failover to the new default gateway when using FHRP.
