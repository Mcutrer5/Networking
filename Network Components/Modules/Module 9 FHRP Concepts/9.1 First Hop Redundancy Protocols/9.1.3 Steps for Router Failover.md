When the active router fails, the redundancy protocol transitions the standby router to the new active router role, as shown in the figure. These are the steps that take place when the active router fails:

1. The standby router stops seeing Hello messages from the forwarding router.
2. The standby router assumes the role of the forwarding router.
3. Because the new forwarding router assumes both the IPv4 and MAC addresses of the virtual router, the host devices see no disruption in service.
