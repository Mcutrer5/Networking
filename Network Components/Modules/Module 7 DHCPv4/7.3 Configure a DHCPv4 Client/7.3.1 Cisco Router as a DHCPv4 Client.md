There are scenarios where you might have access to a DHCP server through your ISP. In these instances, you can configure a Cisco IOS router as a DHCPv4 client. This topic walks you through that process.

Sometimes, Cisco routers in a small office or home office (SOHO) and branch sites have to be configured as DHCPv4 clients in a similar manner to client computers. The method used depends on the ISP. However, in its simplest configuration, the Ethernet interface is used to connect to a cable or DSL modem.

To configure an Ethernet interface as a DHCP client, use the **ip address dhcp** interface configuration mode command.

In the figure, assume that an ISP has been configured to provide select customers with IP addresses from the 209.165.201.0/27 network range after the G0/0/1 interface is configured with the **ip address dhcp** command.
