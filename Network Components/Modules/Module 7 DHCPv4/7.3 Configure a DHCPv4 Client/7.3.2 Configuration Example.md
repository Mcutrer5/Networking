To configure an Ethernet interface as a DHCP client, use the **ip address dhcp** interface configuration mode command, as shown in the example. This configuration assumes that the ISP has been configured to provide select customers with IPv4 addressing information.

```
SOHO(config)# interface G0/0/1
SOHO(config-if)# ip address dhcp
SOHO(config-if)# no shutdown
Sep 12 10:01:25.773: %DHCP-6-ADDRESS_ASSIGN: Interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1 assigned DHCP address 209.165.201.12, mask 255.255.255.224, hostname SOHO
```

The **show ip interface g0/1** command confirms that the interface is up and that the address was allocated by a DHCPv4 server.

```
SOHO# show ip interface g0/0/1
GigabitEthernet0/0/1 is up, line protocol is up
  Internet address is 209.165.201.12/27
  Broadcast address is 255.255.255.255
  Address determined by DHCP
(output omitted)
```
