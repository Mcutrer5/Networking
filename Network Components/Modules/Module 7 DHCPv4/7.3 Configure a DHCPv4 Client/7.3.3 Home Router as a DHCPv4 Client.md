Home routers are typically already set to receive IPv4 addressing information automatically from the ISP. This is so that customers can easily set up the router and connect to the internet.

For example, the figure shows the default WAN setup page for a Packet Tracer wireless router. Notice that the internet connection type is set to **Automatic Configuration – DHCP**. This selection is used when the router is connected to a DSL or cable modem and acts as a DHCPv4 client, requesting an IPv4 address from the ISP.

Various manufacturers of home routers will have a similar setup.
