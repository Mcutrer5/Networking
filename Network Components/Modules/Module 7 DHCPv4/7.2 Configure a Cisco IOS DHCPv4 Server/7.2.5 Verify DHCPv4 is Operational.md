The topology shown in the figure is used in the example output. In this example, R1 has been configured to provide DHCPv4 services. PC1 has not been powered up and, therefore, does not have an IP address.

![[7.2.5.png]]

The output for the following commands assumes PC1 has received its IPv4 addressing information from the DHCPv4 server. You may need to enter ipconfig /renew on a Windows PC to force it to send out a DHCPDISCOVER message.Click each button to see the command output verifying that DHCPv4 is operational.

````tabs
tab: Verify Configuration
**Verify the DHCPv4 Configuration**
<br/><br/>
As shown in the example, the **show running-config | section dhcp** command output displays the DHCPv4 commands configured on R1. The **| section** parameter displays only the commands associated with DHCPv4 configuration.
<br/><br/>
```
R1# show running-config | section dhcp
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.10.1 192.168.10.9
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.10.254
ip dhcp pool LAN-POOL-1
 network 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0

 dns-server 192.168.11.5
 domain-name example.com
```

tab: Verify Bindings
**Verify DHCPv4 Bindings**
<br/><br/>
As shown in the example, the operation of DHCPv4 can be verified using the **show ip dhcp binding** command. This command displays a list of all IPv4 address to MAC address bindings that have been provided by the DHCPv4 service.
<br/><br/>
```
R1# show ip dhcp binding
Bindings from all pools not associated with VRF:

```

tab: Verify Statistics
**Verify DHCPv4 Statistics**
<br/><br/>
The output of the **show ip dhcp server statistics** is used to verify that messages are being received or sent by the router. This command displays count information regarding the number of DHCPv4 messages that have been sent and received.
<br/><br/>

tab: Verify Client<br/>Received IPv4<br/>Addressing
**Verify DHCPv4 Client Received IPv4 Addressing**
<br/><br/>
The **ipconfig /all** command, when issued on PC1, displays the TCP/IP parameters, as shown in the example. Because PC1 was connected to the network segment 192.168.10.0/24, it automatically received a DNS suffix, IPv4 address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server address from that pool. No DHCP-specific router interface configuration is required. If a PC is connected to a network segment that has a DHCPv4 pool available, the PC can obtain an IPv4 address from the appropriate pool automatically.
