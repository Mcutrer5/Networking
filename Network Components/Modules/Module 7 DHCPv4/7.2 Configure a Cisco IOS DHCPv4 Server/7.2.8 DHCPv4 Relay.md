In a complex hierarchical network, enterprise servers are usually located centrally. These servers may provide DHCP, DNS, TFTP, and FTP services for the network. Network clients are not typically on the same subnet as those servers. In order to locate the servers and receive services, clients often use broadcast messages.

In the figure, PC1 is attempting to acquire an IPv4 address from a DHCPv4 server using a broadcast message. In this scenario, R1 is not configured as a DHCPv4 server and does not forward the broadcast. Because the DHCPv4 server is located on a different network, PC1 cannot receive an IP address using DHCP. R1 must be configured to relay DHCPv4 messages to the DHCPv4 server.

In this scenario, a network administrator is attempting to renew IPv4 addressing information for PC1. Click each button to see the command output as the network administrator resolves this issue.

PC1 is a Windows computer. The network administrator releases all current IPv4 addressing information using the **ipconfig /release** command. Notice that the IPv4 address is released and no address is shown.
<br/><br/>
```
C:\Users\Student> ipconfig /release

Ethernet adapter Ethernet0:
   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . :                              
```

tab: ipconfig /renew
**ipconfig /renew**
<br/><br/>
Next, the network administrator attempts to renew the IPv4 addressing information with the **ipconfig /renew** command. This command causes PC1 to broadcast a DHCPDISCOVER message. The output shows that PC1 is unable to locate the DHCPv4 server. Because routers do not forward broadcasts, the request is not successful.
<br/>
The network administrator could add DHCPv4 servers on R1 for all subnets. However, this would create additional cost and administrative overhead.
<br/><br/>
```
C:\Users\Student> ipconfig /renew
Windows IP Configuration
An error occurred while renewing interface Ethernet0 : unable to connect to your DHCP server. Request has timed out.
```

tab: ip helper-address
**ip helper-address**
<br/><br/>
A better solution is to configure R1 with the **ip helper-address** _address_ interface configuration command. This will cause R1 to relay DHCPv4 broadcasts to the DHCPv4 server. As shown in the example, the interface on R1 receiving the broadcast from PC1 is configured to relay DHCPv4 address to the DHCPv4 server at 192.168.11.6.
<br/><br/>
```
R1(config)# interface g0/0/0
R1(config-if)# ip helper-address 192.168.11.6
R1(config-if)# end
R1#
```

tab: show ip interface
**show ip interface**
<br/><br/>
When R1 has been configured as a DHCPv4 relay agent, it accepts broadcast requests for the DHCPv4 service and then forwards those requests as a unicast to the IPv4 address 192.168.11.6. The network administrator can use the **show ip interface** command to verify the configuration.
<br/><br/>
```
R1# show ip interface g0/0/0
GigabitEthernet0/0/0 is up, line protocol is up
  Internet address is 192.168.10.1/24
  Broadcast address is 255.255.255.255
  Address determined by setup command
  MTU is 1500 bytes
  Helper address is 192.168.11.6
(output omitted)
```

tab: ipconfig /all
**ipconfig /all**
<br/><br/>
As shown in the output, PC1 is now able to acquire an IPv4 address from the DHCPv4 server as verified with the **ipconfig /all** command.
<br/><br/>
```
C:\Users\Student> ipconfig /all
