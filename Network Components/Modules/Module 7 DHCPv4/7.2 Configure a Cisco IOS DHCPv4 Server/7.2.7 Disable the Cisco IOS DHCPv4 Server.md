The DHCPv4 service is enabled by default. To disable the service, use the **no service dhcp** global configuration mode command. Use the **service dhcp** global configuration mode command to re-enable the DHCPv4 server process, as shown in the example. Enabling the service has no effect if the parameters are not configured.

**Note:** Clearing the DHCP bindings or stopping and restarting the DHCP service may result in duplicate IP addresses being temporarily assigned on the network.

```
R1(config)# no service dhcp
R1(config)# service dhcp
R1(config)# 
```
