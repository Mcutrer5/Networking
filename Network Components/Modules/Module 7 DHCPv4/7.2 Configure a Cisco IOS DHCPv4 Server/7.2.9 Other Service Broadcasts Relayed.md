DHCPv4 is not the only service that the router can be configured to relay. By default, the **ip helper-address** command forwards the following eight UDP services:

- Port 37: Time
- Port 49: TACACS
- Port 53: DNS
- Port 67: DHCP/BOOTP server
- Port 68: DHCP/BOOTP client
- Port 69: TFTP
- Port 137: NetBIOS name service
- Port 138: NetBIOS datagram service
