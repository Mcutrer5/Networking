Prior to lease expiration, the client begins a two-step process to renew the lease with the DHCPv4 server, as shown in the figure:

**1. DHCP Request (DHCPREQUEST)**

Before the lease expires, the client sends a DHCPREQUEST message directly to the DHCPv4 server that originally offered the IPv4 address. If a DHCPACK is not received within a specified amount of time, the client broadcasts another DHCPREQUEST so that one of the other DHCPv4 servers can extend the lease.

**2. DHCP Acknowledgment (DHCPACK)**

On receiving the DHCPREQUEST message, the server verifies the lease information by returning a DHCPACK.

**Note:** These messages (primarily the DHCPOFFER and DHCPACK) can be sent as unicast or broadcast according to IETF RFC 2131.
