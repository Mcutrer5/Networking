When the client boots (or otherwise wants to join a network), it begins a four-step process to obtain a lease:

1. DHCP Discover (DHCPDISCOVER)
2. DHCP Offer (DHCPOFFER)
3. DHCP Request (DHCPREQUEST)
4. DHCP Acknowledgment (DHCPACK)

**Step 1. DHCP Discover (DHCPDISCOVER)**
<br/><br/>
The client starts the process using a broadcast DHCPDISCOVER message with its own MAC address to discover available DHCPv4 servers. Because the client has no valid IPv4 information at bootup, it uses Layer 2 and Layer 3 broadcast addresses to communicate with the server. The purpose of the DHCPDISCOVER message is to find DHCPv4 servers on the network.

**Step 2. DHCP Offer (DHCPOFFER)**
<br/><br/>
When the DHCPv4 server receives a DHCPDISCOVER message, it reserves an available IPv4 address to lease to the client. The server also creates an ARP entry consisting of the MAC address of the requesting client and the leased IPv4 address of the client. The DHCPv4 server sends the binding DHCPOFFER message to the requesting client.

tab: DHCP Request
**Step 3. DHCP Request (DHCPREQUEST)**
<br/><br/>
When the client receives the DHCPOFFER from the server, it sends back a DHCPREQUEST message. This message is used for both lease origination and lease renewal. When used for lease origination, the DHCPREQUEST serves as a binding acceptance notice to the selected server for the parameters it has offered and an implicit decline to any other servers that may have provided the client a binding offer.

Many enterprise networks use multiple DHCPv4 servers. The DHCPREQUEST message is sent in the form of a broadcast to inform this DHCPv4 server and any other DHCPv4 servers about the accepted offer.

tab: DHCP Acknowledgement
**Step 4. DHCP Acknowledgment (DHCPACK)**
<br/><br/>
On receiving the DHCPREQUEST message, the server may verify the lease information with an ICMP ping to that address to ensure it is not being used already, it will create a new ARP entry for the client lease, and reply with a DHCPACK message. The DHCPACK message is a duplicate of the DHCPOFFER, except for a change in the message type field. When the client receives the DHCPACK message, it logs the configuration information and may perform an ARP lookup for the assigned address. If there is no reply to the ARP, the client knows that the IPv4 address is valid and starts using it as its own.
