DHCP snooping does not rely on source MAC addresses. Instead, DHCP snooping determines whether DHCP messages are from an administratively configured trusted or untrusted source. It then filters DHCP messages and rate-limits DHCP traffic from untrusted sources.

Devices under your administrative control, such as switches, routers, and servers, are trusted sources. Any device beyond the firewall or outside your network is an untrusted source. In addition, all access ports are generally treated as untrusted sources. The figure shows an example of trusted and untrusted ports.

Notice that the rouge DHCP server would be on an untrusted port after enabling DHCP snooping. All interfaces are treated as untrusted by default. Trusted interfaces are typically trunk links and ports directly connected to a legitimate DHCP server. These interfaces must be explicitly configured as trusted.

A DHCP table is built that includes the source MAC address of a device on an untrusted port and the IP address assigned by the DHCP server to that device. The MAC address and IP address are bound together. Therefore, this table is called the DHCP snooping binding table.
