The reference topology for this DHCP snooping example is shown in the figure. Notice that F0/5 is an untrusted port because it connects to a PC. F0/1 is a trusted port because it connects to the DHCP server.

The following is an example of how to configure DHCP snooping on S1. Notice how DHCP snooping is first enabled. Then the upstream interface to the DHCP server is explicitly trusted. Next, the range of FastEthernet ports from F0/5 to F0/24 are untrusted by default, so a rate limit is set to six packets per second. Finally, DHCP snooping is enabled on VLANS 5, 10, 50, 51, and 52.

```
S1(config)# ip dhcp snooping
S1(config)# interface f0/1
S1(config-if)# ip dhcp snooping trust
S1(config-if)# exit
S1(config)# interface range f0/5 - 24
S1(config-if-range)# ip dhcp snooping limit rate 6  
S1(config-if)# exit
S1(config)# ip dhcp snooping vlan 5,10,50-52
S1(config)# end
S1#
```

Use the **show ip dhcp snooping** privileged EXEC command to verify DHCP snooping and **show ip dhcp snooping binding** to view the clients that have received DHCP information, as shown in the example.

**Note**: DHCP snooping is also required by Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI), which is the next topic
