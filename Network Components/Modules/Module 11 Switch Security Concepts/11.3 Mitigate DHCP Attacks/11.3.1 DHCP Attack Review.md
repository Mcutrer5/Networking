The goal of a DHCP starvation attack is to create a Denial of Service (DoS) for connecting clients. DHCP starvation attacks require an attack tool such as Gobbler. Recall that DHCP starvation attacks can be effectively mitigated by using port security because Gobbler uses a unique source MAC address for each DHCP request sent.

However, mitigating DHCP spoofing attacks requires more protection. Gobbler could be configured to use the actual interface MAC address as the source Ethernet address, but specify a different Ethernet address in the DHCP payload. This would render port security ineffective because the source MAC address would be legitimate.

DHCP spoofing attacks can be mitigated by using DHCP snooping on trusted ports.
