As a quick review, a VLAN hopping attack can be launched in one of three ways:

- Spoofing DTP messages from the attacking host to cause the switch to enter trunking mode. From here, the attacker can send traffic tagged with the target VLAN, and the switch then delivers the packets to the destination.
- Introducing a rogue switch and enabling trunking. The attacker can then access all the VLANs on the victim switch from the rogue switch.
- Another type of VLAN hopping attack is a double-tagging (or double-encapsulated) attack. This attack takes advantage of the way hardware on most switches operate.
