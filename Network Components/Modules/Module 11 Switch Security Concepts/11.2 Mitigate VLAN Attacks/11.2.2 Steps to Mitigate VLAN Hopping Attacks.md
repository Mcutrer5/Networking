Use the following steps to mitigate VLAN hopping attacks:

**Step 1:** Disable DTP (auto trunking) negotiations on non-trunking ports by using the **switchport mode access** interface configuration command.

**Step 2:** Disable unused ports and put them in an unused VLAN.

**Step 3:** Manually enable the trunk link on a trunking port by using the **switchport mode trunk** command.

**Step 4:** Disable DTP (auto trunking) negotiations on trunking ports by using the **switchport nonegotiate** command.

**Step 5:** Set the native VLAN to a VLAN other than VLAN 1 by using the **switchport trunk native vlan** _vlan_number_ command.

For example, assume the following:

- FastEthernet ports 0/1 through fa0/16 are active access ports
- FastEthernet ports 0/17 through 0/20 are not currently in use
- FastEthernet ports 0/21 through 0/24 are trunk ports.

VLAN hopping can be mitigated by implementing the following configuration.

```
S1(config)# interface range fa0/1 - 16
S1(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
S1(config-if-range)# exit
S1(config)# 
S1(config)# interface range fa0/17 - 20
S1(config-if-range)# switchport mode access
S1(config-if-range)# switchport access vlan 1000
S1(config-if-range)# exit
S1(config)# 
S1(config)# interface range fa0/21 - 24
S1(config-if-range)# switchport mode trunk
S1(config-if-range)# switchport nonegotiate 
S1(config-if-range)# switchport trunk native vlan 999
S1(config-if-range)# end
S1#
```

- FastEthernet ports 0/1 to 0/16 are access ports and therefore trunking is disabled by explicitly making them access ports.
- FastEthernet ports 0/17 to 0/20 are unused ports and are disabled and assigned to an unused VLAN.
- FastEthernet ports 0/21 to 0/24 are trunk links and are manually enabled as trunks with DTP disabled. The native VLAN is also changed from the default VLAN 1 to an unused VLAN 999.
