In a typical ARP attack, a threat actor can send unsolicited ARP replies to other hosts on the subnet with the MAC Address of the threat actor and the IP address of the default gateway. To prevent ARP spoofing and the resulting ARP poisoning, a switch must ensure that only valid ARP Requests and Replies are relayed.

Dynamic ARP inspection (DAI) requires DHCP snooping and helps prevent ARP attacks by:

- Not relaying invalid or gratuitous ARP Replies out to other ports in the same VLAN.
- Intercepting all ARP Requests and Replies on untrusted ports.
- Verifying each intercepted packet for a valid IP-to-MAC binding.
- Dropping and logging ARP Replies coming from invalid to prevent ARP poisoning.
- Error-disabling the interface if the configured DAI number of ARP packets is exceeded.
