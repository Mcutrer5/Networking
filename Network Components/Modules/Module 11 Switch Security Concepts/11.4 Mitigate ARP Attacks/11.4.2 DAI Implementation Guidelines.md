To mitigate the chances of ARP spoofing and ARP poisoning, follow these DAI implementation guidelines:

- Enable DHCP snooping globally.
- Enable DHCP snooping on selected VLANs.
- Enable DAI on selected VLANs.
- Configure trusted interfaces for DHCP snooping and ARP inspection.

It is generally advisable to configure all access switch ports as untrusted and to configure all uplink ports that are connected to other switches as trusted.

The sample topology in the figure identifies trusted and untrusted ports.
