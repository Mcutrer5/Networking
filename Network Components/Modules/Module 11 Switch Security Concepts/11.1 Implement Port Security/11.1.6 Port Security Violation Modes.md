If the MAC address of a device attached to the port differs from the list of secure addresses, then a port violation occurs. By default, the port enters the error-disabled state.

To set the port security violation mode, use the following command:

```
Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security violation { protect | restrict | shutdown}
```

The following tables show how a switch reacts based on the configured violation mode.

#### Security Violation Mode Descriptions

| Mode                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **shutdown**<br><br>(default) | The port transitions to the error-disabled state immediately, turns off the port LED, and sends a syslog message. It increments the violation counter. When a secure port is in the error-disabled state, an administrator must re-enable it by entering the **shutdown** and **no shutdown** commands. |
| **restrict**                  | The port drops packets with unknown source addresses until you remove a sufficient number of secure MAC addresses to drop below the maximum value or increase the maximum value. This mode causes the Security Violation counter to increment and generates a syslog message.                           |
| **protect**                   | This is the least secure of the security violation modes. The port drops packets with unknown MAC source addresses until you remove a sufficient number of secure MAC addresses to drop below the maximum value or increase the maximum value. No syslog message is sent.                               |

#### Security Violation Mode Comparison

| Violation Mode | Discards Offending Traffic | Sends Syslog Message | Increase Violation Counter | Shuts Down Port |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| Protect        | Yes                        | No                   | No                         | No              |
| Restrict       | Yes                        | Yes                  | Yes                        | No              |
| Shutdown       | Yes                        | Yes                  | Yes                        | Yes             |

The following example shows an administrator changing the security violation to “restrict”. The output of the **show port-security interface** command confirms that the change has been made.

```
S1(config)# interface f0/1
S1(config-if)# switchport port-security violation restrict
S1(config-if)# end
S1#
S1# show port-security interface f0/1
