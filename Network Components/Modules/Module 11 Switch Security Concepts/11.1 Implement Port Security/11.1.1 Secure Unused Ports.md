Layer 2 devices are considered to be the weakest link in a company’s security infrastructure. Layer 2 attacks are some of the easiest for hackers to deploy but these threats can also be mitigated with some common Layer 2 solutions.

All switch ports (interfaces) should be secured before the switch is deployed for production use. How a port is secured depends on its function.

A simple method that many administrators use to help secure the network from unauthorized access is to disable all unused ports on a switch. For example, if a Catalyst 2960 switch has 24 ports and there are three Fast Ethernet connections in use, it is good practice to disable the 21 unused ports. Navigate to each unused port and issue the Cisco IOS **shutdown** command. If a port must be reactivated at a later time, it can be enabled with the **no shutdown** command.

To configure a range of ports, use the **interface range** command.

```
Switch(config)# interface range type module/first-number – last-number
```

For example, to shutdown ports for Fa0/8 through Fa0/24 on S1, you would enter the following command.

```
S1(config)# interface range fa0/8 - 24
S1(config-if-range)# shutdown
%LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface FastEthernet0/8, changed state to administratively down
(output omitted)
%LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface FastEthernet0/24, changed state to administratively down
S1(config-if-range)#
```
