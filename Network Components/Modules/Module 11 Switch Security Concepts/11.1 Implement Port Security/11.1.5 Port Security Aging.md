Port security aging can be used to set the aging time for static and dynamic secure addresses on a port. Two types of aging are supported per port:

- **Absolute** – The secure addresses on the port are deleted after the specified aging time.
- **Inactivity** – The secure addresses on the port are deleted only if they are inactive for the specified aging time.

Use aging to remove secure MAC addresses on a secure port without manually deleting the existing secure MAC addresses. Aging time limits can also be increased to ensure past secure MAC addresses remain, even while new MAC addresses are added. Aging of statically configured secure addresses can be enabled or disabled on a per-port basis.

Use the **switchport port-security** aging command to enable or disable static aging for the secure port, or to set the aging time or type.

```
Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security aging { static | time time | type {absolute | inactivity}}
```

The parameters for the command are described in the table.

|**Parameter**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**static**|Enable aging for statically configured secure addresses on this port.|
|**time** _time_|Specify the aging time for this port. The range is 0 to 1440 minutes. If the time is 0, aging is disabled for this port.|
|**type absolute**|Set the absolute aging time. All the secure addresses on this port age out exactly after the time (in minutes) specified and are removed from the secure address list.|
|**type inactivity**|Set the inactivity aging type. The secure addresses on this port age out only if there is no data traffic from the secure source address for the specified time period.|

**Note**: MAC addresses are shown as 24 bits for simplicity.

The example shows an administrator configuring the aging type to 10 minutes of inactivity and by using the **show port-security interface** command to verify the configuration.

```
S1(config)# interface fa0/1
S1(config-if)# switchport port-security aging time 10 
S1(config-if)# switchport port-security aging type inactivity 
S1(config-if)# end
S1# show port-security interface fa0/1
