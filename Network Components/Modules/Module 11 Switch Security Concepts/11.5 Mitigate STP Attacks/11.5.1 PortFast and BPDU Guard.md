Recall that network attackers can manipulate the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to conduct an attack by spoofing the root bridge and changing the topology of a network. To mitigate Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) manipulation attacks, use PortFast and Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) Guard:

- **PortFast** – PortFast immediately brings an interface configured as an access or trunk port to the forwarding state from a blocking state, bypassing the listening and learning states. Apply to all end-user ports. PortFast should only be configured on ports attached to end devices.
- **BPDU Guard** – BPDU guard immediately error disables a port that receives a BPDU. Like PortFast, BPDU guard should only be configured on interfaces attached to end devices.

In the figure, the access ports for S1 should be configured with PortFast and BPDU Guard.
