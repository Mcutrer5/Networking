Even though PortFast is enabled, the interface will still listen for BPDUs. Unexpected BPDUs might be accidental, or part of an unauthorized attempt to add a switch to the network.

If any BPDUs are received on a BPDU Guard enabled port, that port is put into error-disabled state. This means the port is shut down and must be manually re-enabled or automatically recovered through the **errdisable recovery cause psecure_violation** global command.

BPDU Guard can be enabled on a port by using the **spanning-tree bpduguard enable** interface configuration command. Alternatively, Use the **spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default** global configuration command to globally enable BPDU guard on all PortFast-enabled ports.

To display information about the state of spanning tree, use the **show spanning-tree summary** command. In the example, PortFast default and BPDU Guard are both enabled as the default state for ports configured as access mode.

**Note**: Always enable BPDU Guard on all PortFast-enabled ports.
