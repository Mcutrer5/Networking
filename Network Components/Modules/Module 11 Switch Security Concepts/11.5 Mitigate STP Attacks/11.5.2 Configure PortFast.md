PortFast bypasses the STP listening and learning states to minimize the time that access ports must wait for STP to converge. If PortFast is enabled on a port connecting to another switch, there is a risk of creating a spanning-tree loop.

PortFast can be enabled on an interface by using the **spanning-tree portfast** interface configuration command. Alternatively, Portfast can be configured globally on all access ports by using the **spanning-tree portfast default** global configuration command.

To verify whether PortFast is enabled globally you can use either the **show running-config | begin span** command or the **show spanning-tree summary** command. To verify if PortFast is enabled an interface, use the **show running-config interface** _type/number_ command, as shown in the following example. The **show** **spanning-tree interface** _type/number_ **detail** command can also be used for verification.

Notice that when PortFast is enabled, warning messages are displayed.

```
S1(config)# interface fa0/1
S1(config-if)# switchport mode access
S1(config-if)# spanning-tree portfast
%Warning: portfast should only be enabled on ports connected to a single
 host. Connecting hubs, concentrators, switches, bridges, etc... to this
 interface when portfast is enabled, can cause temporary bridging loops.
 Use with CAUTION
%Portfast has been configured on FastEthernet0/1 but will only
 have effect when the interface is in a non-trunking mode.
S1(config-if)# exit
S1(config)# spanning-tree portfast default
%Warning: this command enables portfast by default on all interfaces. You
 should now disable portfast explicitly on switched ports leading to hubs,
 switches and bridges as they may create temporary bridging loops.
