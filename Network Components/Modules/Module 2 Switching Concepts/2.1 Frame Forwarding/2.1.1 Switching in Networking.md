The concept of switching and forwarding frames is universal in networking and telecommunications. Various types of switches are used in LANs, WANs, and in the public switched telephone network (PSTN).

The decision on how a switch forwards traffic is made based on the flow of that traffic. There are two terms associated with frames entering and leaving an interface:

- **Ingress** - This is used to describe the port where a frame enters the device.
- **Egress** - This is used to describe the port that frames will use when leaving the device.

A LAN switch maintains a table that is referenced when forwarding traffic through the switch. The only intelligence of a LAN switch is its ability to use its table to forward traffic. A LAN switch forwards traffic based on the ingress port and the destination MAC address of an Ethernet frame. With a LAN switch, there is only one master switching table that describes a strict association between MAC addresses and ports; therefore, an Ethernet frame with a given destination address always exits the same egress port, regardless of the ingress port it enters.

**Note:** An Ethernet frame will never be forwarded out the same port it was on which it was received.
