The store-and-forward switching method drops frames that do not pass the FCS check. Therefore, it does not forward invalid frames.

By contrast, the cut-through switching method may forward invalid frames because no FCS check is performed. However, cut-through switching has the ability to perform rapid frame switching. This means the switch can make a forwarding decision as soon as it has looked up the destination MAC address of the frame in its MAC address table, as shown in the figure.

The switch does not have to wait for the rest of the frame to enter the ingress port before making its forwarding decision.

Fragment free switching is a modified form of cut-through switching in which the switch only starts forwarding the frame. Fragment free switching provides better error checking than cut-through, with practically no increase in latency.

The lower latency speed of cut-through switching makes it more appropriate for extremely demanding, high-performance computing (HPC) applications that require process-to-process latencies of 10 microseconds or less.

The cut-through switching method can forward frames with errors. If there is a high error rate (invalid frames) in the network, cut-through switching can have a negative impact on bandwidth, thereby clogging up bandwidth with damaged and invalid frames.
