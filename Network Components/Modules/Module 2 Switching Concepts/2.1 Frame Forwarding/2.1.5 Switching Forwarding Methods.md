Switches make Layer 2 forwarding decisions very quickly. This is because of software on application-specific-integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs reduce the frame-handling time within the device and allow the device to manage an increased number of frames without degrading performance.

Layer 2 switches use one of two methods to switch frames:

- **Store-and-forward switching** - This method makes a forwarding decision on a frame after it has received the entire frame and checked the frame for errors using a mathematical error-checking mechanism known as a cyclic redundancy check (CRC). Store-and-forward switching is Cisco’s primary LAN switching method.
- **Cut-through switching** - This method begins the forwarding process after the destination MAC address of an incoming frame and the egress port have been determined.
