A switch is made up of integrated circuits and the accompanying software that controls the data paths through the switch. Switches use destination MAC addresses to direct network communications through the switch, out the appropriate port, toward the destination.

For a switch to know which port to use to transmit a frame, it must first learn which devices exist on each port. As the switch learns the relationship of ports to devices, it builds a table called a MAC address table. This table is stored in content addressable memory (CAM) which is a special type of memory used in high-speed searching applications. For this reason, the MAC address table is sometimes also called the CAM table.

LAN switches determine how to handle incoming data frames by maintaining the MAC address table. A switch populates its MAC address table by recording the source MAC address of each device connected to each of its ports. The switch references the information in the MAC address table to send frames destined for a specific device out of the port which has been assigned to that device.
