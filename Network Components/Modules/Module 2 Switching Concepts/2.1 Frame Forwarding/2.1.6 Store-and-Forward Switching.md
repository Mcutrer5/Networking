Store-and-forward switching, as distinguished from cut-through switching, has the following two primary characteristics:

- **Error checking** - After receiving the entire frame on the ingress port, the switch compares the frame check sequence (FCS) value in the last field of the datagram against its own FCS calculations. The FCS is an error checking process that helps to ensure that the frame is free of physical and data-link errors. If the frame is error-free, the switch forwards the frame. Otherwise, the frame is dropped.
- **Automatic buffering** - The ingress port buffering process used by store-and-forward switches provides the flexibility to support any mix of Ethernet speeds. For example, handling an incoming frame traveling into a 100 Mbps Ethernet port that must be sent out a 1 Gbps interface would require using the store-and-forward method. With any mismatch in speeds between the ingress and egress ports, the switch stores the entire frame in a buffer, computes the FCS check, forwards it to the egress port buffer and then sends it.

The figure illustrates how store-and-forward makes a decision based on the Ethernet frame.
