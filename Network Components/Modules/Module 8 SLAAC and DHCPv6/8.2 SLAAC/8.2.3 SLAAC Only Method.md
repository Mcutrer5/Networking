The SLAAC only method is enabled by default when the **ipv6 unicast-routing** command is configured. All enabled Ethernet interfaces with an IPv6 GUA configured will start sending RA messages with the A flag set to 1, and the O and M flags set to 0, as shown in the figure.

The **A = 1** flag suggests to the client that it create its own IPv6 GUA using the prefix advertised in the RA. The client can create its own Interface ID using either Extended Unique Identifier method (EUI-64) or have it randomly generated.

The **O =0** and **M=0** flags instruct the client to use the information in the RA message exclusively. The RA includes the prefix, prefix-length, DNS server, MTU, and default gateway information. There is no further information available from a DHCPv6 server.

In the example, PC1 is enabled to obtain its IPv6 addressing information automatically. Because of the settings of the A, O and M flags, PC1 performs SLAAC only, using the information contained in the RA message sent by R1.

The default gateway address is the source IPv6 address of the RA message, which is the LLA for R1. The default gateway can only be obtained automatically from the RA message. A DHCPv6 server does not provide this information.
