Refer to the following topology to see how SLAAC is enabled to provide stateless dynamic GUA allocation.

Assume R1 GigabitEthernet 0/0/1 has been configured with the indicated IPv6 GUA and link-local addresses. Click each button for an explanation of how R1 is enabled for SLAAC.

tab: Verify IPv6 Addresses
The output of the **show ipv6 interface** command displays the current settings on the G0/0/1 interface.
<br/>
As highlighted, R1 has been assigned the following IPv6 addresses:
<br/><br/>
- **Link-local IPv6 address** - fe80::1
- **GUA and subnet** - 2001:db8:acad:1::1 and 2001:db8:acad:1::/64
- **IPv6 all-nodes group** - ff02::1
<br/><br/>
```
R1# show ipv6 interface G0/0/1
GigabitEthernet0/0/1 is up, line protocol is up
  IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is FE80::1
  No Virtual link-local address(es):
  Description: Link to LAN
  Global unicast address(es):
    2001:DB8:ACAD:1::1, subnet is 2001:DB8:ACAD:1::/64
  Joined group address(es):
    FF02::1
    FF02::1:FF00:1
(output omitted)
R1#
```

tab: Enable IPv6 Routing
Although the router interface has an IPv6 configuration, it is still not yet enabled to send RAs containing address configuration information to hosts using SLAAC.
<br/><br/>
To enable the sending of RA messages, a router must join the IPv6 all-routers group using the **ipv6 unicast-routing** global config command, as show in the output.
<br/><br/>
```
R1(config)# ipv6 unicast-routing
R1(config)# exit
R1# 
```

tab: Verify SLAAC<br/>is Enabled
The IPv6 all-routers group responds to the IPv6 multicast address ff02::2. You can use the **show ipv6 interface** command to verify if a router is enabled as shown, in the output.
<br/><br/>
An IPv6-enabled Cisco router sends RA messages to the IPv6 all-nodes multicast address ff02::1 every 200 seconds.
<br/><br/>
```
R1# show ipv6 interface G0/0/1 | section Joined
  Joined group address(es):
    FF02::1
    FF02::2
    FF02::1:FF00:1
R1#
