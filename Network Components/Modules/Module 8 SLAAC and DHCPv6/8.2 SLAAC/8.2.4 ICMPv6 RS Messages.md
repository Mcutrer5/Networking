A router sends RA messages every 200 seconds. However, it will also send an RA message if it receives an RS message from a host.

When a client is configured to obtain its addressing information automatically, it sends an RS message to the IPv6 all-routers multicast address of ff02::2.

The figure illustrates how a host initiates the SLAAC method.

1. PC1 has just booted and has not yet received an RA message. Therefore, it sends an RS message to the IPv6 all-routers multicast address of ff02::2 requesting an RA.<br/>
2. R1 is part of the IPv6 all-routers group and received the RS message. It generates an RA containing the local network prefix and prefix length (e.g., 2001:db8:acad:1::/64). It then sends the RA message to the IPv6 all-nodes multicast address of ff02::1. PC1 uses this information to create a unique IPv6 GUA.
