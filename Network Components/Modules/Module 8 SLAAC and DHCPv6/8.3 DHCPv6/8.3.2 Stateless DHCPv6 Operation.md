The stateless DHCPv6 server is only providing information that is identical for all devices on the network such as the IPv6 address of a DNS server.

This process is known as stateless DHCPv6 because the server is not maintaining any client state information (i.e., a list of available and allocated IPv6 addresses). The stateless DHCPv6 server is only providing configuration parameters for clients, not IPv6 addresses.

The figure illustrates stateless DHCPv6 operation.

<div style="width: 75%; font-style: italic; font-size: .8em; border: solid grey 2px; padding: 4px;">
1. PC1 receives a stateless DHCP RA message. The RA message contains the network prefix and prefix length. The M flag for stateful DHCP is set to the default value 0. The A=1 flag tells the client to use SLAAC. The O=1 flag informs the client that additional configuration information is available from a stateless DHCPv6 server.<br/>
2. The client sends a DHCPv6 SOLICIT message looking for a stateless DHCPv6 server to obtain additional information (e.g., DNS server addresses).
