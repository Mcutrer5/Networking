Stateless DHCPv6 is enabled on a router interface using the **ipv6 nd other-config-flag** interface configuration command. This sets the O flag to 1.

The highlighted output confirms the RA will tell receiving hosts to use stateless autoconfigure (A flag = 1) and contact a DHCPv6 server to obtain another configuration information (O flag = 1).

**Note:** You can use the **no ipv6 nd other-config-flag** to reset the interface to the default SLAAC only option (O flag = 0).

```
R1(config-if)# ipv6 nd other-config-flag
R1(config-if)# end
R1#
R1# show ipv6 interface g0/0/1 | begin ND
