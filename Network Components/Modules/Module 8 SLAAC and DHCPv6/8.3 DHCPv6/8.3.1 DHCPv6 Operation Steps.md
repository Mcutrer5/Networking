This topic explains stateless and stateful DHCPv6. Stateless DHCPv6 uses parts of SLAAC to ensure that all the necessary information is supplied to the host. Stateful DHCPv6 does not require SLAAC.

Although DHCPv6 is similar to DHCPv4 in what it provides, the two protocols are independent of each other.

**Note:** DHCPv6 is defined in RFC 3315.

The host begins the DHCPv6 client/server communications after stateless DHCPv6 or stateful DHCPv6 is indicated in the RA.

Server to client DHCPv6 messages use UDP destination port 546 while client to server DHCPv6 messages use UDP destination port 547.

The steps for DHCPv6 operations are as follows:

1. The host sends an RS message.
2. The router responds with an RA message.
3. The host sends a DHCPv6 SOLICIT message.
4. The DHCPv6 server responds with an ADVERTISE message.
5. The host responds to the DHCPv6 server.
6. The DHCPv6 server sends a REPLY message.

**Step 1. Host sends an RS message.**
<br/><br/>
PC1 sends an RS message to all IPv6-enabled routers.

**Step 2. Router responds with an RA message.**
<br/><br/>
R1 receives the RS and responds with an RA indicating that the client is to initiate communication with a DHCPv6 server.

**Step 3. Host sends a DHCPv6 SOLICIT message.**
<br/><br/>
The client, now a DHCPv6 client, needs to locate a DHCPv6 server and sends a DHCPv6 SOLICIT message to the reserved IPv6 multicast all-DHCPv6-servers address of ff02::1:2. This multicast address has link-local scope, which means routers do not forward the messages to other networks.

**Step 4. DHCPv6 server responds with an ADVERTISE message.**
<br/><br/>
One or more DHCPv6 servers respond with a DHCPv6 ADVERTISE unicast message. The ADVERTISE message informs the DHCPv6 client that the server is available for DHCPv6 service.

**Step 5. Host responds to DHCPv6 server.**
<br/><br/>
The PC1 response depends on whether it is using stateful or stateless DHCPv6:
<br/><br/>
- **Stateless DHCPv6 client** - The client creates an IPv6 address using the prefix in the RA message and a self-generated Interface ID. The client then sends a DHCPv6 INFORMATION-REQUEST message to the DHCPv6 server requesting additional configuration parameters (e.g., DNS server address).
- **Stateful DHCPv6 client** - The client sends a DHCPv6 REQUEST message to the DHCPv6 server to obtain all necessary IPv6 configuration parameters.

**Step 6. DHCPv6 sends a REPLY message.**
<br/><br/>
The server sends a DHCPv6 REPLY unicast message to the client. The content of the message varies depending on if it is replying to a REQUEST or INFORMATION-REQUEST message.
<br/><br/>
**Note:** The client will use the source IPv6 Link-local address of the RA as its default gateway address. A DHCPv6 server does not provide this information.
