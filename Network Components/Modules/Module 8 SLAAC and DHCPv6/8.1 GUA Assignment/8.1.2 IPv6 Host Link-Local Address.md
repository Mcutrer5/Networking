When automatic IPv6 addressing is selected, the host will attempt to automatically obtain and configure IPv6 address information on the interface. The host will use one of three methods defined by the Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) Router Advertisement (RA) message received on the interface. An IPv6 router that is on the same link as the host sends out RA messages that suggest to the hosts how to obtain their IPv6 addressing information. The IPv6 link-local address is automatically created by the host when it boots and the Ethernet interface is active. The example **ipconfig** output shows an automatically generated link-local address (LLA) on an interface.

In the figure, notice that the interface does not have an IPv6 GUA. The reason is because, in this example, the network segment does not have a router to provide network configuration instructions for the host or the host has not been configured with at static IPv6 address.

**Note:** Host operating systems will at times show a link-local address appended with a "%" and a number. This is known as a Zone ID or Scope ID. It is used by the OS to associate the LLA with a specific interface.
