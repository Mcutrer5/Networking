The decision of how a client will obtain an IPv6 GUA depends on the settings within the RA message.

An ICMPv6 RA message includes three flags to identify the dynamic options available to a host, as follows:

- **A flag** - This is the Address Autoconfiguration flag. Use Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) to create an IPv6 GUA.
- **O flag** - This is the Other Configuration flag. Other information is available from a stateless DHCPv6 server.
- **M flag** - This is the Managed Address Configuration flag. Use a stateful DHCPv6 server to obtain an IPv6 GUA.

Using different combinations of the A, O and M flags, RA messages inform the host about the dynamic options available.

The figure illustrates these three methods.
