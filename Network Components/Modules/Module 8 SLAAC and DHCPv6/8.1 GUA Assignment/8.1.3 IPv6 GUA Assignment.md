IPv6 was designed to simplify how a host can acquire its IPv6 configuration. By default, an IPv6-enabled router advertises its IPv6 information. This allows a host to dynamically create or acquire its IPv6 configuration.

The IPv6 GUA can be assigned dynamically using stateless and stateful services, as shown in the figure.

All stateless and stateful methods in this module use ICMPv6 RA messages to suggest to the host how to create or acquire its IPv6 configuration. Although host operating systems follow the suggestion of the RA, the actual decision is ultimately up to the host.
