All MAC tables have a fixed size and consequently, a switch can run out of resources in which to store MAC addresses. MAC address flooding attacks take advantage of this limitation by bombarding the switch with fake source MAC addresses until the switch MAC address table is full.

When this occurs, the switch treats the frame as an unknown unicast and begins to flood all incoming traffic out all ports on the same VLAN without referencing the MAC table. This condition now allows a threat actor to capture all of the frames sent from one host to another on the local LAN or local VLAN.

**Note**: Traffic is flooded only within the local LAN or VLAN. The threat actor can only capture traffic within the local LAN or VLAN to which the threat actor is connected.

The figure shows how a threat actor can easily use the network attack tool **macof** to overflow a MAC address table.

1. The threat actor is connected to VLAN 10 and uses **macof** to rapidly generate many random source and destination MAC and IP addresses. <br/>
2. Over a short period of time, the switch’s MAC table fills up. <br/>
3. When the MAC table is full, the switch begins to flood all frames that it receives. As long as **macof** continues to run, the MAC table remains full and the switch continues to flood all incoming frames out every port associated with VLAN 10.<br/>
4. The threat actor then uses packet sniffing software to capture frames from any and all devices connected to VLAN 10.

If the threat actor stops **macof** from running or is discovered and stopped, the switch eventually ages out the older MAC address entries from the table and begins to act like a switch again.
