Network attackers can manipulate the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to conduct an attack by spoofing the root bridge and changing the topology of a network. Attackers can make their hosts appear as root bridges; and therefore, capture all traffic for the immediate switched domain.

To conduct an STP manipulation attack, the attacking host broadcasts STP bridge protocol data units (BPDUs) containing configuration and topology changes that will force spanning-tree recalculations, as shown in the figure. The BPDUs sent by the attacking host announce a lower bridge priority in an attempt to be elected as the root bridge.

If successful, the attacking host becomes the root bridge, as shown in the figure, and can now capture a variety of frames that would otherwise not be accessible.

This STP attack is mitigated by implementing BPDU Guard on all access ports. BPDU Guard is discussed in more detail later in the course.
