Recall that hosts broadcast ARP Requests to determine the MAC address of a host with a particular IP address. This is typically done to discover the MAC address of the default gateway. All hosts on the subnet receive and process the ARP Request. The host with the matching IP address in the ARP Request sends an ARP Reply.

According to the ARP RFC, a client is allowed to send an unsolicited ARP Reply called a “gratuitous ARP.” When a host sends a gratuitous ARP, other hosts on the subnet store the MAC address and IP address contained in the gratuitous ARP in their ARP tables.

The problem is that an attacker can send a gratuitous ARP message containing a spoofed MAC address to a switch, and the switch would update its MAC table accordingly. Therefore, any host can claim to be the owner of any IP and MAC address combination they choose. In a typical attack, a threat actor can send unsolicited ARP Replies to other hosts on the subnet with the MAC Address of the threat actor and the IP address of the default gateway.

There are many tools available on the internet to create ARP man-in-the-middle attacks including dsniff, Cain & Abel, ettercap, Yersinia, and others. IPv6 uses ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol for Layer 2 address resolution. IPv6 includes strategies to mitigate Neighbor Advertisement spoofing, similar to the way IPv6 prevents a spoofed ARP Reply.

ARP spoofing and ARP poisoning are mitigated by implementing DAI.

**Normal State with Converged MAC Tables**

Each device has an accurate MAC table with the correct IP and MAC addresses for the other devices on the LAN.

tab: Step 2
**ARP Spoofing Attack**

The threat actor sends two spoofed gratuitous ARP Replies in an attempt to replace R1 as the default gateway:

1. The first one informs all devices on the LAN that the threat actor’s MAC address (CC:CC:CC) maps to R1’s IP address, 10.0.0.1.
2. The second one informs all devices on the LAN that the threat actor’s MAC address (CC:CC:CC) maps to PC1’s IP address, 10.0.0.11.

**ARP Poisoning Attack with Man-in-the-Middle Attack**

R1 and PC1 remove the correct entry for each other’s MAC address and replace it with PC2’s MAC address. The threat actor has now poisoned the ARP caches of all devices on the subnet. ARP poisoning leads to various man-in-the-middle attacks, posing a serious security threat to the network.
