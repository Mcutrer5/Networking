AAA stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting. The AAA concept is similar to using a credit card, as shown in the figure. The credit card identifies who can use it, how much that user can spend, and keeps an account of what items or services the user purchased.

AAA provides the primary framework to set up access control on a network device. AAA is a way to control who is permitted to access a network (authenticate), what they can do while they are there (authorize), and to audit what actions they performed while accessing the network (accounting).
