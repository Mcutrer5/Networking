Local and server-based are two common methods of implementing AAA authentication.

**Local AAA Authentication**

Local AAA stores usernames and passwords locally in a network device such as the Cisco router. Users authenticate against the local database, as shown in figure. Local AAA is ideal for small networks.

1. The client establishes a connection with the router. <br/>
2. The AAA router prompts the user for a username and password. <br/>
3. The router authenticates the username and password using the local database and the user is provided access to the network based on information in the local database.
</div>

**Server-Based AAA Authentication**

With the server-based method, the router accesses a central AAA server, as shown in figure. The AAA server contains the usernames and passwords for all users. The router uses either the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) or Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS+) protocols to communicate with the AAA server. When there are multiple routers and switches, server-based AAA is more appropriate.
