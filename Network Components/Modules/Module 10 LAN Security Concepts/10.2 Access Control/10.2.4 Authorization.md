AAA authorization is automatic and does not require users to perform additional steps after authentication. Authorization governs what users can and cannot do on the network after they are authenticated.

Authorization uses a set of attributes that describes the userâ€™s access to the network. These attributes are used by the AAA server to determine privileges and restrictions for that user, as shown in the figure.
