The news media commonly covers attacks on enterprise networks. Simply search the internet for “latest network attacks” to find up-to-date information on current attacks. Most likely, these attacks will involve one or more of the following:

- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** – This is a coordinated attack from many devices, called zombies, with the intention of degrading or halting public access to an organization’s website and resources.
- **Data Breach** – This is an attack in which an organization’s data servers or hosts are compromised to steal confidential information.
- **Malware** – This is an attack in which an organization’s hosts are infected with malicious software that cause a variety of problems. For example, ransomware such as WannaCry, shown in the figure, encrypts the data on a host and locks access to it until a ransom is paid.
