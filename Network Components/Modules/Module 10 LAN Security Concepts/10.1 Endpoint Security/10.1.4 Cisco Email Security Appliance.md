Content security appliances include fine-grained control over email and web browsing for an organization’s users.

According to the Cisco’s Talos Intelligence Group, in June 2019, 85% of all email sent was spam. Phishing attacks are a particularly virulent form of spam. Recall that a phishing attack entices the user to click a link or open an attachment. Spear phishing targets high-profile employees or executives that may have elevated login credentials. This is particularly crucial in today’s environment where, according to the SANS Institute, 95% of all attacks on enterprise networks are the result of a successful spear phishing attack.

The Cisco ESA is a device that is designed to monitor Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). The Cisco ESA is constantly updated by real-time feeds from the Cisco Talos, which detects and correlates threats and solutions by using a worldwide database monitoring system. This threat intelligence data is pulled by the Cisco ESA every three to five minutes. These are some of the functions of the Cisco ESA:

- Block known threats.
- Remediate against stealth malware that evaded initial detection.
- Discard emails with bad links (as shown in the figure).
- Block access to newly infected sites.
- Encrypt content in outgoing email to prevent data loss.

In the figure, the Cisco ESA discards the email with bad links.

1. Threat actor sends a phishing attack to an important host on the network.
2. The firewall forwards all email to the ESA.
3. The ESA analyzes the email, logs it, and if it is malware discards it.
