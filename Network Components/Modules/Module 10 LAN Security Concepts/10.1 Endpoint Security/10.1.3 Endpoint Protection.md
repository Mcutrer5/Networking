LAN devices such as switches, wireless LAN controllers (WLCs), and other access point (AP) devices interconnect endpoints. Most of these devices are susceptible to the LAN-related attacks that are covered in this module.

But many attacks can also originate from inside the network. If an internal host is infiltrated, it can become a starting point for a threat actor to gain access to critical system devices, such as servers and sensitive data.

Endpoints are hosts which commonly consist of laptops, desktops, servers, and IP phones, as well as employee-owned devices that are typically referred to as bring your own devices (BYODs). Endpoints are particularly susceptible to malware-related attacks that originate through email or web browsing. These endpoints have typically used traditional host-based security features, such as antivirus/antimalware, host-based firewalls, and host-based intrusion prevention systems (HIPSs). However, today endpoints are best protected by a combination of NAC, host-based AMP software, an email security appliance (ESA), and a web security appliance (WSA). Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) products include endpoint solutions such as Cisco AMP for Endpoints.

The figure is a simple topology representing all the network security devices and endpoint solutions discussed in this module.
