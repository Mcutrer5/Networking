Security is only as strong as the weakest link in the system, and Layer 2 is considered to be that weak link. This is because LANs were traditionally under the administrative control of a single organization. We inherently trusted all persons and devices connected to our LAN. Today, with BYOD and more sophisticated attacks, our LANs have become more vulnerable to penetration. Therefore, in addition to protecting Layer 3 to Layer 7, network security professionals must also mitigate attacks to the Layer 2 LAN infrastructure.

The first step in mitigating attacks on the Layer 2 infrastructure is to understand the underlying operation of Layer 2 and the threats posed by the Layer 2 infrastructure.

Attacks against the Layer 2 LAN infrastructure are described in the table and are discussed in more detail later in this module.

#### Layer 2 Attacks

| **Category**                 | **Examples**                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **MAC Table Attacks**        | Includes MAC address flooding attacks.                                                                            |
| **VLAN Attacks**             | Includes VLAN hopping and VLAN double-tagging attacks. It also includes attacks between devices on a common VLAN. |
| **DHCP Attacks**             | Includes DHCP starvation and DHCP spoofing attacks.                                                               |
| **ARP Attacks**              | Includes ARP spoofing and ARP poisoning attacks.                                                                  |
| **Address Spoofing Attacks** | Includes MAC address and IP address spoofing attacks.                                                             |
| **STP Attacks**              | Includes Spanning Tree Protocol manipulation attacks.                                                             |
