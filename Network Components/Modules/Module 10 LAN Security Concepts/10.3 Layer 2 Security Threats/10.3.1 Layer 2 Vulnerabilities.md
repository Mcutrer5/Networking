The previous two topics discussed securing endpoints. In this topic, you will continue to learn about ways to secure the LAN by focusing on the frames found in the data link layer (Layer 2) and the switch.

Recall that the OSI reference model is divided into seven layers which work independently of each other. The figure shows the function of each layer and the core elements that can be exploited.

Network administrators routinely implement security solutions to protect the elements in Layer 3 up through Layer 7. They use VPNs, firewalls, and IPS devices to protect these elements. However, if Layer 2 is compromised, then all the layers above it are also affected. For example, if a threat actor with access to the internal network captured Layer 2 frames, then all the security implemented on the layers above would be useless. The threat actor could cause a lot of damage on the Layer 2 LAN networking infrastructure.
