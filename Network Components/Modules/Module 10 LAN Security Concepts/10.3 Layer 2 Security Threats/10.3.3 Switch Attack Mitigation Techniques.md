The table provides an overview of Cisco solutions to help mitigate Layer 2 attacks.

#### Layer 2 Attack Mitigation

|**Solution**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Port Security**|Prevents many types of attacks including MAC address flooding attacks and DHCP starvation attacks.|
|**DHCP Snooping**|Prevents DHCP starvation and DHCP spoofing attacks.|
|**Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)**|Prevents ARP spoofing and ARP poisoning attacks.|
|**IP Source Guard (IPSG)**|Prevents MAC and IP address spoofing attacks|

These Layer 2 solutions will not be effective if the management protocols are not secured. For example, the management protocols Syslog, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), telnet, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and most other common protocols are insecure; therefore, the following strategies are recommended:

- Always use secure variants of these protocols such as SSH, Secure Copy Protocol (SCP), Secure FTP (SFTP), and Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS).
- Consider using out-of-band management network to manage devices.
- Use a dedicated management VLAN where nothing but management traffic resides.
- Use ACLs to filter unwanted access.
