Now that you know what EtherChannel is, this topic explains how to configure it. The following guidelines and restrictions are useful for configuring EtherChannel:

- **EtherChannel support** - All Ethernet interfaces must support EtherChannel with no requirement that interfaces be physically contiguous.
- **Speed and duplex** - Configure all interfaces in an EtherChannel to operate at the same speed and in the same duplex mode.
- **VLAN match** - All interfaces in the EtherChannel bundle must be assigned to the same VLAN or be configured as a trunk (shown in the figure).
- **Range of VLANs** - An EtherChannel supports the same allowed range of VLANs on all the interfaces in a trunking EtherChannel. If the allowed range of VLANs is not the same, the interfaces do not form an EtherChannel, even when they are set to **auto** or **desirable** mode.

The figure shows a configuration that would allow an EtherChannel to form between S1 and S2.

In the next figure, S1 ports are configured as half duplex. Therefore, an EtherChannel will not form between S1 and S2.

If these settings must be changed, configure them in port channel interface configuration mode. Any configuration that is applied to the port channel interface also affects individual interfaces. However, configurations that are applied to the individual interfaces do not affect the port channel interface. Therefore, making configuration changes to an interface that is part of an EtherChannel link may cause interface compatibility issues.

The port channel can be configured in access mode, trunk mode (most common), or on a routed port.
