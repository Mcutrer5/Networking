All interfaces within an EtherChannel must have the same configuration of speed and duplex mode, native and allowed VLANs on trunks, and access VLAN on access ports. Ensuring these configurations will significantly reduce network problems related to EtherChannel. Common EtherChannel issues include the following:

- Assigned ports in the EtherChannel are not part of the same VLAN, or not configured as trunks. Ports with different native VLANs cannot form an EtherChannel.
- Trunking was configured on some of the ports that make up the EtherChannel, but not all of them. It is not recommended that you configure trunking mode on individual ports that make up the EtherChannel. When configuring a trunk on an EtherChannel, verify the trunking mode on the EtherChannel.
- If the allowed range of VLANs is not the same, the ports do not form an EtherChannel even when PAgP is set to the **auto** or **desirable** mode.
- The dynamic negotiation options for PAgP and LACP are not compatibly configured on both ends of the EtherChannel.

**Note:** It is easy to confuse PAgP or LACP with DTP, because they are all protocols used to automate behavior on trunk links. PAgP and LACP are used for link aggregation (EtherChannel). DTP is used for automating the creation of trunk links. When an EtherChannel trunk is configured, typically EtherChannel (PAgP or LACP) is configured first and then DTP.
