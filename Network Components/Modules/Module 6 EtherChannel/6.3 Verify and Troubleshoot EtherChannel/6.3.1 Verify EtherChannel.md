As always, when you configure devices in your network, you must verify your configuration. If there are problems, you will also need to be able to troubleshoot and fix them. This topic gives you the commands to verify, as well as some common EtherChannel network problems and their solutions.

The verification command examples will use the topology shown in the figure

````tabs
tab: show interface</br>port-channel
The **show interfaces port-channel** command displays the general status of the port channel interface. In the figure, the Port Channel 1 interface is up.
</br>
```
S1# show interfaces port-channel 1
Port-channel1 is up, line protocol is up (connected)
  Hardware is EtherChannel, address is c07b.bcc4.a981 (bia c07b.bcc4.a981)
  MTU 1500 bytes, BW 200000 Kbit/sec, DLY 100 usec,
     reliability 255/255, txload 1/255, rxload 1/255
(output omitted)
```

tab: show etherchannel</br>summary
When several port channel interfaces are configured on the same device, use the **show etherchannel summary** command to display one line of information per port channel. In the output, the switch has one EtherChannel configured; group 1 uses LACP.

The interface bundle consists of the FastEthernet0/1 and FastEthernet0/2 interfaces. The group is a Layer 2 EtherChannel and it is in use, as indicated by the letters SU next to the port channel number.
</br>
```
S1# show etherchannel summary
Flags:  D - down        P - bundled in port-channel
        I - stand-alone s - suspended
        H - Hot-standby (LACP only)
        R - Layer3      S - Layer2
        U - in use      N - not in use, no aggregation
        f - failed to allocate aggregator
        M - not in use, minimum links not met
        m - not in use, port not aggregated due to minimum links not met
        u - unsuitable for bundling
        w - waiting to be aggregated
        d - default port
        A - formed by Auto LAG
Number of channel-groups in use: 1
Number of aggregators:           1

```

tab: show etherchannel</br>port-channel
Use the **show etherchannel port-channel** command to display information about a specific port channel interface, as shown in the output. In the example, the Port Channel 1 interface consists of two physical interfaces, FastEthernet0/1 and FastEthernet0/2. It uses LACP in active mode. It is properly connected to another switch with a compatible configuration, which is why the port channel is said to be in use.
</br>
```
S1# show etherchannel port-channel

```

tab: show interfaces</br>etherchannel
On any physical interface member of an EtherChannel bundle, the **show interfaces etherchannel** command can provide information about the role of the interface in the EtherChannel, as shown in the output. The interface FastEthernet0/1 is part of the EtherChannel bundle 1. The protocol for this EtherChannel is LACP.
