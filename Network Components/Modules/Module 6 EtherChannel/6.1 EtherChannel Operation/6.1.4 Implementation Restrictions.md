EtherChannel implementation on the catalyst 2960 switch has certain implementation restrictions, including the following:

- Interface types cannot be mixed. For example, Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet cannot be mixed within a single EtherChannel.
- Currently each EtherChannel can consist of up to eight compatibly-configured Ethernet ports. EtherChannel provides full-duplex bandwidth up to 800 Mbps (Fast EtherChannel) or 8 Gbps (Gigabit EtherChannel) between one switch and another switch or host.
- The Cisco Catalyst 2960 Layer 2 switch currently supports up to six EtherChannels. However, as new IOSs are developed and platforms change, some cards and platforms may support increased numbers of ports within an EtherChannel link, as well as support an increased number of Gigabit EtherChannels.
- The individual EtherChannel group member port configuration must be consistent on both devices. If the physical ports of one side are configured as trunks, the physical ports of the other side must also be configured as trunks within the same native VLAN. Additionally, all ports in each EtherChannel link must be configured as Layer 2 ports.
- Each EtherChannel has a logical port channel interface, as shown in the figure. A configuration applied to the port channel interface affects all physical interfaces that are assigned to that interface.
