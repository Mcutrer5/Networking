EtherChannels can be formed through negotiation using one of two protocols, Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP) or Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). These protocols allow ports with similar characteristics to form a channel through dynamic negotiation with adjoining switches.

**Note:** It is also possible to configure a static or unconditional EtherChannel without PAgP or LACP.
