One distinguishing feature between switches and routers is the type of interfaces supported by each. For example, Layer 2 switches support LANs; therefore, they have multiple FastEthernet or Gigabit Ethernet ports. The dual stack topology in the figure is used to demonstrate the configuration of router IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces.
