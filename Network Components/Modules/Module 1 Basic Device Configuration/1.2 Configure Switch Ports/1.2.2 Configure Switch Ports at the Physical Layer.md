Switch ports can be manually configured with specific duplex and speed settings. Use the **duplex** interface configuration mode command to manually specify the duplex mode for a switch port. Use the **speed** interface configuration mode command to manually specify the speed. For example, both switches in the topology should always operate in full-duplex at 100 Mbps.

The table shows the commands for S1. The same commands can be applied to S2.

The default setting for both duplex and speed for switch ports on Cisco Catalyst 2960 and 3560 switches is auto. The 10/100/1000 ports operate in either half- or full-duplex mode when they are set to 10 or 100 Mbps and operate only in full-duplex mode when it is set to 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps). Autonegotiation is useful when the speed and duplex settings of the device connecting to the port are unknown or may change. When connecting to known devices such as servers, dedicated workstations, or network devices, a best practice is to manually set the speed and duplex settings.

When troubleshooting switch port issues, it is important that the duplex and speed settings should be checked.

**Note:** Mismatched settings for the duplex mode and speed of switch ports can cause connectivity issues. Autonegotiation failure creates mismatched settings.

All fiber-optic ports, such as 1000BASE-SX ports, operate only at one preset speed and are always full-duplex.
