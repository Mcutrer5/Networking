The ports of a switch can be configured independently for different needs. This topic covers how to configure switch ports, how to verify your configurations, common errors, and how to troubleshoot switch configuration issues.

Full-duplex communication increases bandwidth efficiency by allowing both ends of a connection to transmit and receive data simultaneously. This is also known as bidirectional communication and it requires microsegmentation. A microsegmented LAN is created when a switch port has only one device connected and is operating in full-duplex mode. There is no collision domain associated with a switch port operating in full-duplex mode.

Unlike full-duplex communication, half-duplex communication is unidirectional. Half-duplex communication creates performance issues because data can flow in only one direction at a time, often resulting in collisions. Half-duplex connections are typically seen in older hardware, such as hubs. Half-duplex hubs have been replaced by switches that use full-duplex communications by default.

The figure illustrates full-duplex and half-duplex communication.

Gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gb NICs require full-duplex connections to operate. In full-duplex mode, the collision detection circuit on the NIC is disabled. Full-duplex offers 100 percent efficiency in both directions (transmitting and receiving).
