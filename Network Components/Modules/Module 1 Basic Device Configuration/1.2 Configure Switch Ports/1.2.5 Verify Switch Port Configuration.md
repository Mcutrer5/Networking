The **show running-config** command can be used to verify that the switch has been correctly configured. From the sample abbreviated output on S1, some important information is shown in the figure:

- Fast Ethernet 0/18 interface is configured with the management VLAN 99
- VLAN 99 is configured with an IPv4 address of 172.17.99.11 255.255.255.0
- The default gateway is set to 172.17.99.1

```

```

The **show interfaces** command is another commonly used command, which displays status and statistics information on the network interfaces of the switch. The **show interfaces** command is frequently used when configuring and monitoring network devices.

The first line of the output for the **show interfaces fastEthernet 0/18** command indicates that the FastEthernet 0/18 interface is up/up, meaning that it is operational. Further down, the output shows that the duplex is full and the speed is 100 Mbps.

```
S1# show interfaces fastEthernet 0/18
