The output from the **show interfaces** command is useful for detecting common media issues. One of the most important parts of this output is the display of the line and data link protocol status, as shown in the example.

```
S1# show interfaces fastEthernet 0/18
FastEthernet0/18 is up, line protocol is up (connected)
Hardware is Fast Ethernet, address is 0025.83e6.9092 (bia 0025.83e6.9092)MTU 
1500 bytes, BW 100000 Kbit/sec, DLY 100 usec,
```

The first parameter (FastEthernet0/18 is up) refers to the hardware layer and indicates whether the interface is receiving a carrier detect signal. The second parameter (line protocol is up) refers to the data link layer and indicates whether the data link layer protocol keepalives are being received.

Based on the output of the **show interfaces** command, possible problems can be fixed as follows:

- If the interface is up and the line protocol is down, a problem exists. There could be an encapsulation type mismatch, the interface on the other end could be error-disabled, or there could be a hardware problem.
- If the line protocol and the interface are both down, a cable is not attached, or some other interface problem exists. For example, in a back-to-back connection, the other end of the connection may be administratively down.
- If the interface is administratively down, it has been manually disabled (the **shutdown** command has been issued) in the active configuration.

The **show interfaces** command output displays counters and statistics for the FastEthernet0/18 interface, as highlighted in the example.

Some media errors are not severe enough to cause the circuit to fail but do cause network performance issues. The table explains some of these common errors which can be detected using the **show interfaces** command

| Error Type      | Definition                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Input Errors    | Total number of errors. It includes runts, giants, no buffer, CRC, frame, overrun, and ignored counts                                                                            |
| Runts           | Frames that are discarded because they are smaller than the minimum frame size for the medium. For instance, any Ethernet frame that is less than 64 bytes is considered a runt. |
| Giants          | Frames that are discarded because they exceed the maximum frame size for the medium. For example, any Ethernet frame that is greater than 1,518 bytes is considered a giant.     |
| CRC             | CRC errors are generated when the calculated checksum is not the same as the checksum received                                                                                   |
| Output Errors   | Sum of all errors that prevented the final transmission of datagrams out of the interface that is being examined.                                                                |
| Collisions      | Number of messages retransmitted because of an Ethernet collision.                                                                                                               |
| Late Collisions | A collision that occurs after 512 bits of the frame have been transmitted.                                                                                                       |
