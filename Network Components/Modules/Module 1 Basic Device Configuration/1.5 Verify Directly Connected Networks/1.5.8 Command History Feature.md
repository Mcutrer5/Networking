The command history feature is useful because it temporarily stores the list of executed commands to be recalled.

To recall commands in the history buffer, press **Ctrl**+**P** or the **Up Arrow** key. The command output begins with the most recent command. Repeat the key sequence to recall successively older commands. To return to more recent commands in the history buffer, press **Ctrl**+**N** or the **Down Arrow** key. Repeat the key sequence to recall successively more recent commands.

By default, command history is enabled and the system captures the last 10 command lines in its history buffer. Use the **show history** privileged EXEC command to display the contents of the buffer.

It is also practical to increase the number of command lines that the history buffer records during the current terminal session only. Use the **terminal history size** user EXEC command to increase or decrease the size of the buffer.

An example of the **terminal history size** and **show history** commands is shown in the figure.

```
R1# terminal history size 200
R1# show history  
  show ip int brief  
  show interface g0/0/0  
  show ip route  
  show running-config  
  show history  
  terminal history size 200
```
