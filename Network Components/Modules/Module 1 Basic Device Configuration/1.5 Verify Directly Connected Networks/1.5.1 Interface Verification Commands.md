There is no point in configuring your router unless you verify the configuration and connectivity. This topic covers the commands to use to verify directly connected networks. It includes two Syntax Checkers and a Packet Tracer.

There are several **show** commands that can be used to verify the operation and configuration of an interface. The topology in the figure is used to demonstrate the verification of router interface settings.

The following commands are especially useful to quickly identify the status of an interface:

- **show ip interface brief** and **show ipv6 interface brief** - These display a summary for all interfaces including the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the interface and current operational status.
- **show running-config interface** _interface-id_ - This displays the commands applied to the specified interface.
- **show ip route** and **show ipv6 route** - These display the contents of the IPv4 or IPv6 routing table stored in RAM. In Cisco IOS 15, active interfaces should appear in the routing table with two related entries identified by the code ‘**C**’ (Connected) or ‘**L**’ (Local). In previous IOS versions, only a single entry with the code ‘**C**’ will appear.
