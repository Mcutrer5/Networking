You might not always have direct access to your switch when you need to configure it. You need to be able to access it remotely and it is imperative that your access is secure. This topic discusses how to configure Secure Shell (SSH) for remote access. A Packet Tracer activity gives you the opportunity to try this yourself.

Telnet uses TCP port 23. It is an older protocol that uses unsecure plaintext transmission of both the login authentication (username and password) and the data transmitted between the communicating devices. A threat actor can monitor packets using Wireshark. For example, in the figure the threat actor captured the username **admin** and password **ccna** from a Telnet session.
