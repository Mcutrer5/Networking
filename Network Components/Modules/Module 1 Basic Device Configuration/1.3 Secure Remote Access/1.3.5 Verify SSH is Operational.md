On a PC, an SSH client such as PuTTY, is used to connect to an SSH server. For example, assume the following is configured:

- SSH is enabled on switch S1
- Interface VLAN 99 (SVI) with IPv4 address 172.17.99.11 on switch S1
- PC1 with IPv4 address 172.17.99.21

The figure shows the PuTTY settings for PC1 to initiate an SSH connection to the SVI VLAN IPv4 address of S1.

When connected, the user is prompted for a username and password as shown in the example. Using the configuration from the previous example, the username **admin** and password **ccna** are entered. After entering the correct combination, the user is connected via SSH to the command line interface (CLI) on the Catalyst 2960 switch.

```
Login as: admin
Using keyboard-interactive
Authentication.
Password:
S1> enable
Password: 
S1#
```

To display the version and configuration data for SSH on the device that you configured as an SSH server, use the **show ip ssh** command. In the example, SSH version 2 is enabled.

```
S1# show ip ssh
SSH Enabled - version 2.0
Authentication timeout: 120 secs; Authentication retries: 3
To check the SSH connections to the device, use the show ssh command as shown.
S1# show ssh
%No SSHv1 server connections running.
