To enable SSH on a Catalyst 2960 switch, the switch must be using a version of the IOS software including cryptographic (encrypted) features and capabilities. Use the **show version** command on the switch to see which IOS the switch is currently running. An IOS filename that includes the combination “k9” supports cryptographic (encrypted) features and capabilities. The example shows the output of the **show version** command.

```
S1# show version
Cisco IOS Software, C2960 Software (C2960-LANBASEK9-M), Version 15.0(2)SE7, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)
```
