# Basic Device Configuration

Before you can configure a [[switch]], you need to turn it on and allow it to go through the five-step boot sequence.

After a Cisco switch is powered on, it goes through the following five-step boot sequence:

- **Step 1:** First, the switch loads a power-on self-test ([[POST]]) program stored in [[ROM]]. POST checks the CPU subsystem. It tests the CPU, DRAM, and the portion of the flash device that makes up the flash file system.  
  
- **Step 2:** Next, the switch loads the [[boot loader]] software. The boot loader is a small program stored in ROM that is run immediately after POST successfully completes.  
  
- **Step 3:** The boot loader performs low-level CPU initialization. It initializes the CPU registers, which control where physical memory is mapped, the quantity of memory, and its speed.  
  
- **Step 4:** The boot loader initializes the flash file system on the system board.  
  
- **Step 5:** Finally, the boot loader locates and loads a default IOS operating system software image into memory and gives control of the switch over to the IOS.
