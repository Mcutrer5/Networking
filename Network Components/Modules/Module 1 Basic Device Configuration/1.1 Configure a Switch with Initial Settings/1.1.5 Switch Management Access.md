To prepare a switch for remote management access, the switch must have a switch virtual interface (SVI) configured with an IPv4 address and subnet mask or an IPv6 address and a prefix length for IPv6. The SVI is a virtual interface, not a physical port on the switch. Keep in mind that to manage the switch from a remote network, the switch must be configured with a default gateway. This is very similar to configuring the IP address information on host devices.
