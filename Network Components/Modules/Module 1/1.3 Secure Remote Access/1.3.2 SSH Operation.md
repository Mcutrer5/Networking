Secure Shell (SSH) is a secure protocol that uses TCP port 22. It provides a secure (encrypted) management connection to a remote device. SSH should replace Telnet for management connections. SSH provides security for remote connections by providing strong encryption when a device is authenticated (username and password) and also for the transmitted data between the communicating devices.

For example, the figure shows a Wireshark capture of an SSH session. The threat actor can track the session using the IP address of the administrator device. However, unlike Telnet, with SSH the username and password are encrypted.
