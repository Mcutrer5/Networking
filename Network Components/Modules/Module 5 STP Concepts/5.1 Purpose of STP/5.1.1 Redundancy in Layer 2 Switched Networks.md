This topic covers the causes of loops in a Layer 2 network and briefly explains how spanning tree protocol works. Redundancy is an important part of the hierarchical design for eliminating single points of failure and preventing disruption of network services to users. Redundant networks require the addition of physical paths, but logical redundancy must also be part of the design. Having alternate physical paths for data to traverse the network makes it possible for users to access network resources, despite path disruption. However, redundant paths in a switched Ethernet network may cause both physical and logical Layer 2 loops.

Ethernet LANs require a loop-free topology with a single path between any two devices. A loop in an Ethernet LAN can cause continued propagation of Ethernet frames until a link is disrupted and breaks the loop.
