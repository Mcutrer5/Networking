Path redundancy provides multiple network services by eliminating the possibility of a single point of failure. When multiple paths exist between two devices on an Ethernet network, and there is no spanning tree implementation on the switches, a Layer 2 loop occurs. A Layer 2 loop can result in MAC address table instability, link saturation, and high CPU utilization on switches and end-devices, resulting in the network becoming unusable.

Unlike the Layer 3 protocols, IPv4 and IPv6, Layer 2 Ethernet does not include a mechanism to recognize and eliminate endlessly looping frames. Both IPv4 and IPv6 include a mechanism that limits the number of times a Layer 3 networking device can retransmit a packet. A router will decrement the TTL (Time to Live) in every IPv4 packet, and the Hop Limit field in every IPv6 packet. When these fields are decremented to 0, a router will drop the packet. Ethernet and Ethernet switches have no comparable mechanism for limiting the number of times a switch retransmits a Layer 2 frame. STP was developed specifically as a loop prevention mechanism for Layer 2 Ethernet.
