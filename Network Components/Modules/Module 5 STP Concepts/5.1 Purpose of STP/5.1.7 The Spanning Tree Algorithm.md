STP is based on an algorithm invented by Radia Perlman while working for Digital Equipment Corporation, and published in the 1985 paper "An Algorithm for Distributed Computation of a Spanning Tree in an Extended LAN.‚Äù Her spanning tree algorithm (STA) creates a loop-free topology by selecting a single root bridge where all other switches determine a single least-cost path.

Without the loop prevention protocol, loops would occur rendering a redundant switch network inoperable.

This STA scenario uses an Ethernet LAN with redundant connections between multiple switches.

tab: Select the Root Bridge
**Select the Root Bridge**

The spanning tree algorithm begins by selecting a single root bridge. The figure shows that switch S1 has been selected as the root bridge. In this topology, all links are equal cost (same bandwidth). Each switch will determine a single, least cost path from itself to the root bridge.

**Note:** The STA and STP refers to switches as bridges. This is because in the early days of Ethernet, switches were referred to as bridges.

**Block Redundant Paths**

STP ensures that there is only one logical path between all destinations on the network by intentionally blocking redundant paths that could cause a loop, as shown in the figure. When a port is blocked, user data is prevented from entering or leaving that port. Blocking the redundant paths is critical to preventing loops on the network.

tab: Loop-Free Topology
**Loop-Free Topology**

A blocked port has the effect of making that link a non-forwarding link between the two switches, as shown in the figure. Notice that this creates a topology where each switch has only a single path to the root bridge, similar to branches on a tree that connect to the root of the tree.

tab: Link Failure Causes Recalculation
**Link Failure Causes Recalculation**

The physical paths still exist to provide redundancy, but these paths are disabled to prevent the loops from occurring. If the path is ever needed to compensate for a network cable or switch failure, STP recalculates the paths and unblocks the necessary ports to allow the redundant path to become active. STP recalculations can also occur any time a new switch or new inter-switch link is added to the network.

The figure shows a link failure between switches S2 and S4 causing STP to recalculate. Notice that the previously redundant link between S4 and S5 is now forwarding to compensate for this failure. There is still only one path between every switch and the root bridge.

STP prevents loops from occurring by configuring a loop-free path through the network using strategically placed "blocking-state" ports. The switches running STP are able to compensate for failures by dynamically unblocking the previously blocked ports and permitting traffic to traverse the alternate paths.
