Without STP enabled, Layer 2 loops can form, causing broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast frames to loop endlessly. This can bring down a network within a very short amount of time, sometimes in just a few seconds. For example, broadcast frames, such as an ARP Request are forwarded out all of the switch ports, except the original ingress port. This ensures that all devices in a broadcast domain are able to receive the frame. If there is more than one path for the frame to be forwarded out of, an endless loop can result. When a loop occurs, the MAC address table on a switch will constantly change with the updates from the broadcast frames, which results in MAC database instability. This can cause high CPU utilization, which makes the switch unable to forward frames.

Broadcast frames are not the only type of frames that are affected by loops. Unknown unicast frames sent onto a looped network can result in duplicate frames arriving at the destination device. An unknown unicast frame is when the switch does not have the destination MAC address in its MAC address table and must forward the frame out all ports, except the ingress port.
