A broadcast storm is an abnormally high number of broadcasts overwhelming the network during a specific amount of time. Broadcast storms can disable a network within seconds by overwhelming switches and end devices. Broadcast storms can be caused by a hardware problem such as a faulty NIC or from a Layer 2 loop in the network.

Layer 2 broadcasts in a network, such as ARP Requests are very common. A Layer 2 loop is likely to have immediate and disabling consequences on the network. Layer 2 multicasts are typically forwarded the same way as a broadcast by the switch. So, although IPv6 packets are never forwarded as a Layer 2 broadcast, ICMPv6 Neighbor Discovery uses Layer 2 multicasts.


A host caught in a Layer 2 loop is not accessible to other hosts on the network. Additionally, due to the constant changes in its MAC address table, the switch does not know out of which port to forward unicast frames. In the previous animation, the switches will have the incorrect ports listed for PC1. Any unknown unicast frame destined for PC1 loops around the network, just as the broadcast frames do. More and more frames looping around the network eventually creates a broadcast storm.

To prevent these issues from occurring in a redundant network, some type of spanning tree must be enabled on the switches. Spanning tree is enabled, by default, on Cisco switches to prevent Layer 2 loops from occurring.
