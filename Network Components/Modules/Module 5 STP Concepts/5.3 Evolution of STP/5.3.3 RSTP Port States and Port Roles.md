The port states and port roles between STP and RSTP are similar.

tab: STP and RSTP Port States
**STP and RSTP Port States**
<br/>
As shown in the figure, there are only three port states in RSTP that correspond to the three possible operational states in STP. The 802.1D disabled, blocking, and listening states are merged into a unique 802.1w discarding state.

tab: STP and RSTP Port Roles
**STP and RSTP Port Roles**
<br/>
As shown in the figure, root ports and designated ports are the same for both STP and RSTP. However, there are two RSTP port roles that correspond to the blocking state of STP. In STP, a blocked port is defined as not being the designated or root port. RSTP has two port roles for this purpose.

tab: RSTP Alternate and Backup Ports
**RSTP Alternate and Backup Ports**
<br/>
As shown in the figure, the alternate port has an alternate path to the root bridge. The backup port is a backup to a shared medium, such as a hub. A backup port is less common because hubs are now considered legacy devices.
