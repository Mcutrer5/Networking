STP was and still is an Ethernet loop-prevention protocol. Over the years, organizations required greater resiliency and availability in the LAN. Ethernet LANs went from a few interconnected switches connected to a single router, to a sophisticated hierarchical network design including access, distribution and core layer switches, as shown in the figure.

Depending on the implementation, Layer 2 may include not only the access layer, but also the distribution or even the core layers. These designs may include hundreds of switches, with hundreds or even thousands of VLANs. STP has adapted to the added redundancy and complexity with enhancements, as part of RSTP and MSTP.

An important aspect to network design is fast and predictable convergence when there is a failure or change in the topology. Spanning tree does not offer the same efficiencies and predictabilities provided by routing protocols at Layer 3. The figure shows a traditional hierarchical network design with the distribution and core multilayer switches performing routing.

Layer 3 routing allows for redundant paths and loops in the topology, without blocking ports. For this reason, some environments are transitioning to Layer 3 everywhere except where devices connect to the access layer switch. In other words, the connections between access layer switches and distribution switches would be Layer 3 instead of Layer 2, as shown in the next figure.

Although STP will most likely continue to be used as a loop prevention mechanism in the enterprise, on access layer switches, other technologies are also being used, including the following:

- Multi System Link Aggregation (MLAG)
- Shortest Path Bridging (SPB)
- Transparent Interconnect of Lots of Links (TRILL)

**Note:** These technologies are beyond the scope of this course.
