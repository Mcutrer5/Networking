RSTP (IEEE 802.1w) supersedes the original 802.1D while retaining backward compatibility. The 802.1w STP terminology remains primarily the same as the original IEEE 802.1D STP terminology. Most parameters have been left unchanged. Users that are familiar with the original STP standard can easily configure RSTP. The same spanning tree algorithm is used for both STP and RSTP to determine port roles and topology.

RSTP increases the speed of the recalculation of the spanning tree when the Layer 2 network topology changes. RSTP can achieve much faster convergence in a properly configured network, sometimes in as little as a few hundred milliseconds. If a port is configured to be an alternate port it can immediately change to a forwarding state without waiting for the network to converge.

**Note:** Rapid PVST+ is the Cisco implementation of RSTP on a per-VLAN basis. With Rapid PVST+ an independent instance of RSTP runs for each VLAN.
