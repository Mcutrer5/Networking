If a port is not a root port or a designated port, then it becomes an alternate (or backup) port. Alternate ports and backup ports are in discarding or blocking state to prevent loops. In the figure, the STA has configured port F0/2 on S3 in the alternate role. Port F0/2 on S3 is in the blocking state and will not forward Ethernet frames. All other inter-switch ports are in forwarding state. This is the loop-prevention part of STP.

The Fa0/2 interface of S3 is not a root port or a designated port, so it becomes an alternate or blocked port.
