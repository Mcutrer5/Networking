Because the default priority is 32768, it is possible for two or more switches to have the same priority. In this scenario, where the priorities are the same, the switch with the lowest MAC address will become the root bridge. To ensure that the root bridge decision best meets network requirements, it is recommended that the administrator configure the desired root bridge switch with a lower priority.

In the figure, all switches are configured with the same priority of 32769. Here the MAC address becomes the deciding factor as to which switch becomes the root bridge. The switch with the lowest hexadecimal MAC address value is the preferred root bridge. In this example, S2 has the lowest value for its MAC address and is elected as the root bridge for that spanning tree instance.

**Note:** In the example, the priority of all the switches is 32769. The value is based on the 32768 default bridge priority and the extended system ID (VLAN 1 assignment) associated with each switch (32768+1).
