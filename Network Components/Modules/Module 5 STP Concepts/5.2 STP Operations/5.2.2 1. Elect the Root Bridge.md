The STA designates a single switch as the root bridge and uses it as the reference point for all path calculations. Switches exchange BPDUs to build the loop-free topology beginning with selecting the root bridge.

An election process determines which switch becomes the root bridge. All switches in the broadcast domain participate in the election process. After a switch boots, it begins to send out BPDU frames every two seconds. These BPDU frames contain the BID of the sending switch and the BID of the root bridge, known as the Root ID.

The switch with the lowest BID will become the root bridge. At first, all switches declare themselves as the root bridge with their own BID set as the Root ID. Eventually, the switches learn through the exchange of BPDUs which switch has the lowest BID and will agree on one root bridge.

In the figure, S1 is elected the root bridge because it has the lowest BID.
