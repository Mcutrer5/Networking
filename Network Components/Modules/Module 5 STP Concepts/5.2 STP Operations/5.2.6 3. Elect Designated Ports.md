The loop prevention part of spanning tree becomes evident during these next two steps. After each switch selects a root port, the switches will then select designated ports.

Every segment between two switches will have one designated port. The designated port on the segment (with two switches) that has the LOWEST internal root path cost to the root bridge. In other words, the designated port has the best path to receive traffic leading to the root bridge.

What is not a root port or a designated port becomes an alternate or blocked port. The end result is a single path from every switch to the root bridge.

All ports on the root bridge are designated ports, as shown in the figure. This is because the root bridge has the lowest cost to itself.

If one end of a segment is a root port, then the other end is a designated port. To demonstrate this, the figure shows that switch S4 is connected to S3. The Fa0/1 interface on S4 is its root port because it has the best and only path to the root bridge. The Fa0/3 interface on S3 at the other end of the segment would therefore, be the designated port.

**Note:** All switch ports with end devices (hosts) attached are designated ports.

This leaves only segments between two switches where neither of the switches is the root bridge. In this case, the port on the switch with the least-cost path to the root bridge is the designated port for the segment. For example, in the figure, the last segment is the one between S2 and S3. Both S2 and S3 have the same path cost to the root bridge. The spanning tree algorithm will use the bridge ID as a tie breaker. Although not shown in the figure, S2 has a lower BID. Therefore, the F0/2 port of S2 will be chosen as the designated port. Designated ports are in forwarding state.
