Now you know how loops are created and the basics of using spanning tree protocol to prevent them. This topic will take you, step by step, through the operation of STP. Using the STA, STP builds a loop-free topology in a four-step process:

1. Elect the root bridge.
2. Elect the root ports.
3. Elect designated ports.
4. Elect alternate (blocked) ports.

During STA and STP functions, switches use Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) to share information about themselves and their connections. BPDUs are used to elect the root bridge, root ports, designated ports, and alternate ports. Each BPDU contains a bridge ID (BID) that identifies which switch sent the BPDU. The BID is involved in making many of the STA decisions including root bridge and port roles. As shown in the figure, the BID contains a priority value, an extended system ID, and the MAC address of the switch. The lowest BID value is determined by the combination of these three fields.

**Bridge Priority**

The default priority value for all Cisco switches is the decimal value 32768. The range is 0 to 61440 in increments of 4096. A lower bridge priority is preferable. A bridge priority of 0 takes precedence over all other bridge priorities.

**Extended System ID**

The extended system ID value is a decimal value added to the bridge priority value in the BID to identify the VLAN for this BPDU.

Early implementations of IEEE 802.1D were designed for networks that did not use VLANs. There was a single common spanning tree across all switches. For this reason, in older switches, the extended system ID was not included in the BPDUs. As VLANs became common for network infrastructure segmentation, 802.1D was enhanced to include support for VLANs, which required that the 12-bit VLAN ID be included in the BPDU frame. VLAN information is included in the BPDU frame through the use of the extended system ID.

The extended system ID allows later implementations of STP to have different root bridges for different sets of VLANs. This can allow for redundant, non-forwarding links in a STP topology for one set of VLANs to be used by a different set of VLANs using a different root bridge.

**MAC address**

When two switches are configured with the same priority and have the same extended system ID, the switch having the MAC address with the lowest value, expressed in hexadecimal, will have the lower BID.
