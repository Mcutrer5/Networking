Root port and designated ports are based on the lowest path cost to the root bridge. But what happens if the switch has multiple equal-cost paths to the root bridge? How does a switch designate a root port?

When a switch has multiple equal-cost paths to the root bridge, the switch will determine a port using the following criteria:

1. Lowest sender BID
2. Lowest sender port priority
3. Lowest sender port ID

The figure shows a topology with four switches, including switch S1 as the root bridge. Examining the port roles, port F0/1 on switch S3 and port F0/3 on switch S4 have been selected as root ports because they have the lowest cost path (root path cost) to the root bridge for their respective switches. S2 has two ports, F0/1 and F0/2 with equal cost paths to the root bridge. In this case the bridge IDs of the neighboring switches, S3 and S4, will be used to break the tie. This is known as the sender’s BID. S3 has a BID of 32769.5555.5555.5555 and S4 has a BID of 32769.1111.1111.1111. Because S4 has a lower BID, the F0/1 port of S2, which is the port connected to S4, will be the root port.

To demonstrate these next two criteria, the topology is changed to one where two switches are connected with two equal-cost paths between them. S1 is the root bridge, so both of its ports are designated ports.

S4 has two ports with equal-cost paths to the root bridge. Because both ports are connected to the same switch, the sender’s BID (S1) is equal. So the first step is a tie.

Next on the list is the sender’s (S1) port priority. The default port priority is 128, so both ports on S1 have the same port priority. This is also a tie. However, if either port on S1 was configured with a lower port priority, S4 would put its adjacent port in forwarding state. The other port on S4 would be a blocking state.

**3. Lowest Sender Port ID**

The last tie-breaker is the lowest sender’s port ID. Switch S4 has received BPDUs from port F0/1 and port F0/2 on S1. Remember the decision is based on the sender’s port ID, not the receiver’s port ID. Because the port ID of F0/1 on S1 is lower than port F0/2, the port F0/6 on switch S4 will be the root port. This is the port on S4 that is connected to the F0/1 port on S1.

Port F0/5 on S4 will become an alternate port and placed in the blocking state, which is the loop-prevention part of STP.
