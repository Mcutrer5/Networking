Up until now, we have discussed STP in an environment where there is only one VLAN. However, STP can be configured to operate in an environment with multiple VLANs.

In Per-VLAN Spanning Tree (PVST) versions of STP, there is a root bridge elected for each spanning tree instance. This makes it possible to have different root bridges for different sets of VLANs. STP operates a separate instance of STP for each individual VLAN. If all ports on all switches are members of VLAN 1, then there is only one spanning tree instance.
