After the root bridge has been determined, the STA algorithm is used to select the root port. Every non-root switch will select one root port. The root port is the port closest to the root bridge in terms of overall cost (best path) to the root bridge. This overall cost is known as the internal root path cost.

The internal root path cost is equal to the sum of all the port costs along the path to the root bridge, as shown in the figure. Paths with the lowest cost become preferred, and all other redundant paths are blocked. In the example, the internal root path cost from S2 to the root bridge S1 over path 1 is 19 (based on the IEEE-specified individual port cost) while the internal root path cost over path 2 is 38. Because path 1 has a lower overall path cost to the root bridge, it is the preferred path and F0/1 becomes the root port on S2.
