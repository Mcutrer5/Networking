STP convergence requires three timers, as follows:

- **Hello Timer** -The hello time is the interval between BPDUs. The default is 2 seconds but can be modified to between 1 and 10 seconds.
- **Forward Delay Timer** -The forward delay is the time that is spent in the listening and learning state. The default is 15 seconds but can be modified to between 4 and 30 seconds.
- **Max Age Timer** -The max age is the maximum length of time that a switch waits before attempting to change the STP topology. The default is 20 seconds but be modified to between 6 and 40 seconds.

**Note:** The default times can be changed on the root bridge, which dictates the value of these timers for the STP domain.

STP facilitates the logical loop-free path throughout the broadcast domain. The spanning tree is determined through the information learned by the exchange of the BPDU frames between the interconnected switches. If a switch port transitions directly from the blocking state to the forwarding state without information about the full topology during the transition, the port can temporarily create a data loop. For this reason, STP has five ports states, four of which are operational port states as shown in the figure. The disabled state is considered non-operational.

**Note:** To avoid problems with STP, IEEE recommends a maximum diameter of seven switches when using the default STP timers.

The details of each port state are shown in the table.

| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blocking   | The port is an alternate port and does not participate in frame forwarding. The port receives BPDU frames to determine the location and root ID of the root bridge. BPDU frames also determine which port roles each switch port should assume in the final active STP topology. With a Max Age tiner of 20 seconds, a switch port that has not received an expected BPDU from a neighbor switch will go into the blocking state. |
| Listening  | After the blocking state, a port will move to the listening state. The port receives BPDUs to determine the path to the root. The switch port also transmits its own BPDU frames and informs adjacent switches that the switch port is preparing to participate in the active topology.                                                                                                                                           |
| Learning   | A switch port transitions to the learning state after the listening state. During the learning state, the switch port receives and processes BPDUs and prepares to participate in frame forwarding. It also begins to populate the MAC address table. However, in the learning state, user frames are not forwarded to the destination.                                                                                           |
| Forwarding | In the forwarding state, a switch port is considered part of the active topology. The switch port forwards user traffic and sends and receives BPDU frames.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Disabled   | A switch port in the disabled state does not participate in spanning tree and does not forward frames. The disabled state is set when the switch port is administratively disabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
