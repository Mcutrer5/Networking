Most wireless routers are ready for service out of the box. They are preconfigured to be connected to the network and provide services. For example, the wireless router uses DHCP to automatically provide addressing information to connected devices. However, wireless router default IP addresses, usernames, and passwords can easily be found on the internet. Just enter the search phrase “default wireless router IP address” or “default wireless router passwords” to see a listing of many websites that provide this information. For example, username and password for the wireless router in the figure is “admin”. Therefore, your first priority should be to change these defaults for security reasons.

To gain access to the wireless router’s configuration GUI, open a web browser. In the address field, enter the default IP address for your wireless router. The default IP address can be found in the documentation that came with the wireless router or you can search the internet. The figure shows the IPv4 address 192.168.0.1, which is a common default for many manufacturers. A security window prompts for authorization to access the router GUI. The word admin is commonly used as the default username and password. Again, check your wireless router’s documentation or search the internet.
