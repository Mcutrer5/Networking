Wireless LAN Controllers have ports and interfaces. Ports are the sockets for the physical connections to the wired network. They resemble switch ports. Interfaces are virtual. They are created in software and are very similar to VLAN interfaces. In fact, each interface that will carry traffic from a WLAN is configured on the WLC as a different VLAN. The Cisco 3504 WLC can support 150 access points and 4096 VLANs, however it only has five physical ports, as shown in the figure. This means that each physical port can support many APs and WLANs. The ports on the WLC are essentially trunk ports that can carry traffic from multiple VLANs to a switch for distribution to multiple APs. Each AP can support multiple WLANs.

Basic WLAN configuration on the WLC includes the following steps:

1. Create the WLAN
2. Apply and Enable the WLAN
3. Select the Interface
4. Secure the WLAN
5. Verify the WLAN is Operational
6. Monitor the WLAN
7. View Wireless Client Information
