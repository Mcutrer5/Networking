Most WLC will come with some basic settings and menus that users can quickly access to implement a variety of common configurations. However, as a network administrator, you will typically access the advanced settings. For the Cisco 3504 Wireless Controller, click **Advanced** in the upper right-hand corner to access the advanced **Summary** page, as shown in the figure. From here, you can access all the features of the WLC.
