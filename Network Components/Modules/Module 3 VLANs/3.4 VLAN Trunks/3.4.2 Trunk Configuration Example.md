In the figure, VLANs 10, 20, and 30 support the Faculty, Student, and Guest computers (PC1, PC2, and PC3). The F0/1 port on switch S1 is configured as a trunk port and forwards traffic for VLANs 10, 20, and 30. VLAN 99 is configured as the native VLAN.

<div style="width: 100%; border: solid grey 2px; padding: 4px;">
The subnets associated with each VLAN are:

- VLAN 10 - Faculty/Staff - 172.17.10.0/24
- VLAN 20 - Students - 172.17.20.0/24
- VLAN 30 - Guests - 172.17.30.0/24
- VLAN 99 - Native - 172.17.99.0/24
</div>

The example shows the configuration of port F0/1 on switch S1 as a trunk port. The native VLAN is changed to VLAN 99 and the allowed VLAN list is restricted to 10, 20, 30, and 99

```
S1(config)# interface fastEthernet 0/1
S1(config-if)# switchport mode trunk
S1(config-if)# switchport trunk native vlan 99
S1(config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,99
S1(config-if)# end
```

**Note:** This configuration assumes the use of Cisco Catalyst 2960 switches which automatically use 802.1Q encapsulation on trunk links. Other switches may require manual configuration of the encapsulation. Always configure both ends of a trunk link with the same native VLAN. If 802.1Q trunk configuration is not the same on both ends, Cisco IOS Software reports errors.
