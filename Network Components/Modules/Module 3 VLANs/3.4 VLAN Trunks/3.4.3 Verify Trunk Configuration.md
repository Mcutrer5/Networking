The top highlighted area shows that port F0/1 has its administrative mode set to **trunk**. The port is in trunking mode. The next highlighted area verifies that the native VLAN is VLAN 99. Further down in the output, the bottom highlighted area shows that VLANs 10, 20, 30, and 99 are enabled on the trunk.

**Note:** Another useful command for veryfing trunk interfaces is the **show interface trunk** command.
