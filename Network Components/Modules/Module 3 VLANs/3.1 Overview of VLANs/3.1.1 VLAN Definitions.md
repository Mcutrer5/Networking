Of course organizing your network into smaller networks is not as simple as separating screws and putting them into jars. But it will make your network easier to manage. Virtual LANs (VLANs) provide segmentation and organizational flexibility in a switched network. A group of devices within a VLAN communicate as if each device was attached to the same cable. VLANs are based on logical connections, instead of physical connections.

As shown in the figure, VLANs in a switched network enable users in various departments (i.e., IT, HR, and Sales) to connect to the same network regardless of the physical switch being used or location in a campus LAN.

VLANs allow an administrator to segment networks based on factors such as function, team, or application, without regard for the physical location of the users or devices. Each VLAN is considered a separate logical network. Devices within a VLAN act as if they are in their own independent network, even if they share a common infrastructure with other VLANs. Any switch port can belong to a VLAN.

Unicast, broadcast, and multicast packets are forwarded and flooded only to end devices within the VLAN where the packets are sourced. Packets destined for devices that do not belong to the VLAN must be forwarded through a device that supports routing.

Multiple IP subnets can exist on a switched network, without the use of multiple VLANs. However, the devices will be in the same Layer 2 broadcast domain. This means that any Layer 2 broadcasts, such as an ARP request, will be received by all devices on the switched network, even by those not intended to receive the broadcast.

A VLAN creates a logical broadcast domain that can span multiple physical LAN segments. VLANs improve network performance by separating large broadcast domains into smaller ones. If a device in one VLAN sends a broadcast Ethernet frame, all devices in the VLAN receive the frame, but devices in other VLANs do not.

Using VLANs, network administrators can implement access and security policies according to specific groupings of users. Each switch port can be assigned to only one VLAN (except for a port connected to an IP phone or to another switch).
