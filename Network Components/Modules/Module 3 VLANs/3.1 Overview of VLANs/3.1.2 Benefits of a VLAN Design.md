Each VLAN in a switched network corresponds to an IP network. Therefore, VLAN design must take into consideration the implementation of a hierarchical network-addressing scheme. Hierarchical network addressing means that IP network numbers are applied to network segments or VLANs in a way that takes the network as a whole into consideration. Blocks of contiguous network addresses are reserved for and configured on devices in a specific area of the network, as shown in the figure.

The table lists the benefits of designing a network with VLANs.

| Benefit                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Smaller broadcast domains                  | - VLANs simplify network management because users with similar network requirements can be configured on the same VLAN.<br>- VLANs can be named to make them easier to identify.<br>- In the figure, VLAN 10 was named "Faculty", VLAN 20 "Student", and VLAN 30 "Guest". |
| Improved security                          | - Only users in the same VLAN can communicate together.<br>- Only users in the same VLAN can communicate without the services of a router. The router may have a security feature such as an access control list to restrict communications between VLANs.                |
| Improved IT efficiency                     | - Having separate functions makes managing a project or working with a specialized application easier; an example of such an application is an e-learning development platform for faculty.                                                                               |
| Reduced cost                               | VLANs reduce the need for expensive network upgrades and use the existing bandwidth and uplinks more efficiently, resulting in cost savings.                                                                                                                              |
| Better performance                         | Smaller broadcast domains reduce unnecessary traffic on the network and improve performance.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Simpler project and application management | - VLANs aggregate users and network devices to support business or geographic requirements.<br>                                                                                                                                                                           |
