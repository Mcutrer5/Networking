There are a number of ways to change VLAN port membership.

If the switch access port has been incorrectly assigned to a VLAN, then simply re-enter the **switchport access vlan** _vlan-id_ interface configuration command with the correct VLAN ID. For instance, assume Fa0/18 was incorrectly configured to be on the default VLAN 1 instead of VLAN 20. To change the port to VLAN 20, simply enter **switchport access vlan 20**.

To change the membership of a port back to the default VLAN 1, use the **no switchport access vlan** interface configuration mode command as shown.

In the output for example, Fa0/18 is configured to be on the default VLAN 1 as confirmed by the **show vlan brief** command.

```
S1(config)# interface fa0/18
S1(config-if)# no switchport access vlan
S1(config-if)# end
S1#
S1# show vlan brief
VLAN Name                 Status    Ports

1003 token-ring-default act/unsup 
1004 fddinet-default    act/unsup 
1005 trnet-default      act/unsup
```

Notice that VLAN 20 is still active, even though no ports are assigned to it.

The **show interfaces f0/18 switchport** output can also be used to verify that the access VLAN for interface F0/18 has been reset to VLAN 1 as shown in the output.

```
S1# show interfaces fa0/18 switchport
Name: Fa0/18
Switchport: Enabled
Administrative Mode: static access
Operational Mode: static access
Administrative Trunking Encapsulation: negotiate
Operational Trunking Encapsulation: native
Negotiation of Trunking: Off
Access Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Trunking Native Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
```
