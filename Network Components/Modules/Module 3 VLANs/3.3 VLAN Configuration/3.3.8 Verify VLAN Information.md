After a VLAN is configured, VLAN configurations can be validated using Cisco IOS **show** commands.

The **show vlan** command displays a list of all configured VLANs. The **show vlan** command can also be used with options. The complete syntax is `show vlan [brief | id _vlan-id_ | name _vlan-name_ | summary]`.

The table describes the **show vlan** command options.

| Task                                                                                                          | Command Option   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Display VLAN name, status, and its ports one VLAN per line.                                                   | `brief`          |
| Display information about the identified VLAN ID number. For `vlan-id`, the range is 1 to 4094.               | `id vlan-id`     |
| Display information about the identified VLAN name. The vlan-name is an ASCII string from 1 to 32 characters. | `name vlan-name` |
| Display VLAN summary information.                                                                             | `summary`        |

The **show vlan summary** command displays the count of all configured VLANs.

```
S1# show vlan summary
Number of existing VLANs              : 7
Number of existing VTP VLANs          : 7
Number of existing extended VLANS     : 0
```

Other useful commands are the **show interfaces** _interface-id_ **switchport** and the **show interfaces vlan** _vlan-id_ command. For example, the **show interfaces fa0/18 switchport** command can be used to confirm that the FastEthernet 0/18 port has been correctly assigned to data and voice VLANs.

```
S1# show interfaces fa0/18 switchport
Name: Fa0/18
Switchport: Enabled
Administrative Mode: static access
Operational Mode: static access
Administrative Trunking Encapsulation: dot1q
Operational Trunking Encapsulation: native
Negotiation of Trunking: Off
Access Mode VLAN: 20 (student) 
Trunking Native Mode VLAN: 1 (default)
Voice VLAN: 150
Administrative private-vlan host-association: none
(Output omitted)
```
