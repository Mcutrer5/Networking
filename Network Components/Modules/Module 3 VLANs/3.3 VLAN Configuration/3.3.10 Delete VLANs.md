The **no vlan** _vlan-id_ global configuration mode command is used to remove a VLAN from the switch vlan.dat file.

**Caution:** Before deleting a VLAN, reassign all member ports to a different VLAN first. Any ports that are not moved to an active VLAN are unable to communicate with other hosts after the VLAN is deleted and until they are assigned to an active VLAN.

The entire vlan.dat file can be deleted using the **delete flash:vlan.dat** privileged EXEC mode command. The abbreviated command version (**delete vlan.dat**) can be used if the vlan.dat file has not been moved from its default location. After issuing this command and reloading the switch, any previously configured VLANs are no longer present. This effectively places the switch into its factory default condition with regard to VLAN configurations.

**Note:** To restore a Catalyst switch to its factory default condition, unplug all cables except the console and power cable from the switch. Then enter the **erase startup-config** privileged EXEC mode command followed by the **delete vlan.dat** command.
