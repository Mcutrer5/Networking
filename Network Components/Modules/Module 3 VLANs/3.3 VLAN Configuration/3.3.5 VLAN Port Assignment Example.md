In the figure, port F0/6 on switch S1 is configured as an access port and assigned to VLAN 20. Any device connected to that port will be associated with VLAN 20. Therefore, in our example, PC2 is in VLAN 20.

The example shows the configuration for S1 to assign F0/6 to VLAN 20.

```
S1# configure terminal
S1(config)# interface fa0/6
S1(config-if)# switchport mode access
S1(config-if)# switchport access vlan 20
S1(config-if)# end
```

VLANs are configured on the switch port and not on the end device. PC2 is configured with an IPv4 address and subnet mask that is associated with the VLAN, which is configured on the switch port. In this example, it is VLAN 20. When VLAN 20 is configured on other switches, the network administrator must configure the other student computers to be in the same subnet as PC2 (172.17.20.0/24).
