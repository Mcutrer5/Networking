The example shows how the student VLAN (VLAN 20) is configured on switch S1.

```
S1# configure terminal
S1(config)# vlan 20
S1(config-vlan)# name student
S1(config-vlan)# end
```

**Note:** In addition to entering a single VLAN ID, a series of VLAN IDs can be entered separated by commas, or a range of VLAN IDs separated by hyphens using the **vlan** _vlan-id_ command. For example, entering the **vlan 100,102,105-107** global configuration command would create VLANs 100, 102, 105, 106, and 107.
