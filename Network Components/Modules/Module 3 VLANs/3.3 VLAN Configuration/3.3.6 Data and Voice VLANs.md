An access port can belong to only one data VLAN at a time. However, a port can also be associated to a voice VLAN. For example, a port connected to an IP phone and an end device would be associated with two VLANs: one for voice and one for data.

Consider the topology in the figure. PC5 is connected to the Cisco IP phone, which in turn is connected to the FastEthernet 0/18 interface on S3. To implement this configuration, a data VLAN and a voice VLAN are created.
