VLANs are associated with and configured on individual switch ports. Devices attached to those ports have no concept of VLANs. However, these devices are configured with IP addressing and are members of a specific IP network. This is where the connection between VLAN and IP network is apparent. A VLAN is the equivalent to an IP network (or subnet). VLANs are configured on the switch, whereas IP addressing is configured on the device.


The ports that comprise the connection between switches S2 and S1 (ports F0/1), and between S1 and S3 (ports F0/3) are trunks and have been configured to support all the VLANs in the network.

When S1 receives the broadcast frame on port F0/1, S1 forwards that broadcast frame out of the only other port configured to support VLAN 10, which is port F0/3. When S3 receives the broadcast frame on port F0/3, it forwards that broadcast frame out the only other port configured to support VLAN 10, which is port F0/11. The broadcast frame arrives at the only other computer in the network configured in VLAN 10, which is faculty computer PC4.

When VLANs are implemented on a switch, the transmission of unicast, multicast, and broadcast traffic from a host in a particular VLAN are restricted to the devices that are in that VLAN.
