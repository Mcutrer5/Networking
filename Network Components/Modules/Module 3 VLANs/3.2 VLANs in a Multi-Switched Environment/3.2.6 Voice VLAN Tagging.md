A separate voice VLAN is required to support VoIP. This enables quality of service (QoS) and security policies to be applied to voice traffic.

A Cisco IP phone connects directly to a switch port. An IP host can connect to the IP phone to gain network connectivity as well. The access port connected to the Cisco IP phone can be configured to use two separate VLANs. One VLAN is for voice traffic and the other is a data VLAN to support the host traffic. The link between the switch and the IP phone simulates a trunk link to carry both voice VLAN traffic and data VLAN traffic.

Specifically, the Cisco IP Phone contains an integrated three-port 10/100 switch. The ports provide dedicated connections to the following devices:

- Port 1 connects to the switch or other VoIP device.
- Port 2 is an internal 10/100 interface that carries the IP phone traffic.
- Port 3 (access port) connects to a PC or other device.

The switch access port sends CDP packets instructing the attached IP phone to send voice traffic in one of three ways. The method used varies based on the type of traffic:

- Voice VLAN traffic must be tagged with an appropriate Layer 2 class of service (CoS) priority value
- Access VLAN traffic can also be tagged with a Layer 2 CoS priority value
- Access VLAN is not tagged (no Layer 2 CoS priority value)
