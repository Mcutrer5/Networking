The `switchport mode` command has additional options for negotiating the interface mode. The full command syntax is the following:

```
Switch(config-if)# switchport mode {  access | dynamic {  auto | desirable } |  trunk }
```

The options are described in the table.

| Option              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `access`            | - Puts the interface (access port) into permanent nontrunking mode and negotiates to convert the link into a nontrunk link.<br>- The interface becomes a nontrunk interface, regardless of whether the neighboring interface is a trunk interface.           |
| `dynamic auto`      | - Makes the interface able to convert the link to a trunk link.<br>- The interface becomes a trunk interface if the neighboring interface is set to trunk or desirable mode.<br>- The default switchport mode for all Ethernet interfaces is `dynamic auto`. |
| `dynamic desirable` | - Makes the interface actively attempt to convert the link to a trunk link.<br>- The interface becomes a trunk interface if the neighboring interface is set to trunk, desirable, or dynamic auto mode.                                                      |
| `trunk`             | - Puts the interface into permanent trunking mode and negotiates to convert the neighboring link into a trunk link.<br>- The interface becomes a trunk interface even if the neighboring interface is not a trunk interface.                                 |

Use the **switchport nonegotiate** interface configuration command to stop DTP negotiation. The switch does not engage in DTP negotiation on this interface. You can use this command only when the interface switchport mode is **access** or **trunk**. You must manually configure the neighboring interface as a trunk interface to establish a trunk link.
