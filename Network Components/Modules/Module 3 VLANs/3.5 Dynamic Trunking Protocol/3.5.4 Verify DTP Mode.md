The default DTP mode is dependent on the Cisco IOS Software version and on the platform. To determine the current DTP mode, issue the **show dtp interface** command as shown in the output.

```
S1# show dtp interface fa0/1
DTP information for FastEthernet0/1:
TOS/TAS/TNS: ACCESS/AUTO/ACCESS
TOT/TAT/TNT: NATIVE/NEGOTIATE/NATIVE
Neighbor address 1: C80084AEF101
Neighbor address 2: 000000000000
Hello timer expiration (sec/state): 11/RUNNING
Access timer expiration (sec/state): never/STOPPED
Negotiation timer expiration (sec/state): never/STOPPED
Multidrop timer expiration (sec/state): never/STOPPED
FSM state: S2:ACCESS
# times multi & trunk 0
Enabled: yes
In STP: no
```

**Note:** A general best practice is to set the interface to *trunk* and *nonegotiate* when a trunk link is required. On links where trunking is not intended, DTP should be turned off.
